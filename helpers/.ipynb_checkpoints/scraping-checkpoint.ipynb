But I disagree so strongly with some of the opinions expressed that I\\'m afraid I have to exercise my right to reply. Two things in particular stand out. <br><br>Let me deal with the simpler one first. Some people seem appalled that the author is putting the guilt for this dreadful tragedy on the shoulders of a young girl. She didn\\'t know what she was doing, they say; she was too young to understand the import of her actions, and we shouldn\\'t hold her responsible. Well, it seems to me that this is completely beside the point. The novel, we finally learn, has been written by the girl herself. She\\'s giving herself the blame for what happened. She\\'s evidently spent her whole life wondering why she behaved the way she did, and she still doesn\\'t really know. She\\'s just trying to get the story as straight as she can, mainly so that she can understand it herself, and I found her efforts extremely moving. If anyone is claiming that people don\\'t behave this way, all I can say is that their view of human nature is so different from mine that it\\'ll be hard to have a meaningful conversation on the subject. <br><br>So now the second and more controversial part. Many reviewers dislike the post-modernist aspects. They complain that McEwan is taking a perverse pleasure in tricking the reader into a view of the story which is finally revealed as incorrect; that he\\'s playing the unreliable narrator card out of sheer willfulness. Again, I completely disagree. I don\\'t think these aspects of the book are irrelevant or peripheral; I think they\\'re at the very core of it, and are what make it a great piece of literature. McEwan shows us a girl who becomes an author precisely because she wants to expiate the dreadful feelings of guilt she has suffered all her life. He lets her explain how it happened, in what we eventually discover is a book within a book. And the truly awful thing is that she can\\'t do it. She cops out with a fake happy ending, because she still can\\'t face what she did.<br><br>I don\\'t think this is a trick; I think he\\'s saying something about the very nature of writing. Many, many writers are like Briony. They write to absolve themselves of their guilt, but in the end they don\\'t say what they want to say. It\\'s too horrible to write down. They skirt around the issues, and end up presenting them in a more favourable light. If they\\'re lucky, they may finally reach an age when they are so far removed from what happened that they can tell the story straight. This is what Briony does in the postscript, and I don\\'t find it far-fetched. To take just one example, the first I happen to think of, look at Marguerite Duras. All her life, she kept thinking about her first love affair, and it coloured most of what she wrote. It was only when she was nearly 70 that she could set it down as <i>L\\'Amant</i>.<br><br>Before the events of the fountain, Briony was indeed just a little girl; all she could write was the amusingly mediocre <i>Arabella</i>. Afterwards, she had something that was worth saying, though it took a long time to figure out how to do that. When she\\'d completed her task, she was able to get back to the one she was engaged in when she was interrupted: I love the circular structure, which ends with <i>Arabella</i> being staged 60 years late. Of the many infuriating changes in the movie version, I think I was most annoyed by the removal of this key scene.<br><br>Wood burns, observes Monty Python\\'s logician, as he gives an example of an incorrect syllogism; therefore, all that burns is wood. Similarly, the fact that much trickery is post-modern does not imply that all post-modernism is trickery. This is a great and heart-felt novel.<br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"9120797062424384210\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link39430896\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=39430896&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_39430896\"><a id=\"like_count_review_39430896\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/39430896?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">687 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/39430896?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_39430896\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/39430896/comments?reverse=true\">View all 79 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_9154704\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/9154704\">\\n    <a title=\"Sarah\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/48216-sarah\"><img alt=\"Sarah\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1392259462p2/48216.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/9154704?book_show_action=true\">Nov 15, 2007</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Sarah\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Sarah\" href=\"/user/show/48216-sarah\">Sarah</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/48216-sarah?shelf=favorites\">favorites</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer9154704\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6025545161893510223\">In World War II England, 13-year-old Briony Tallis misinterprets her older sister’s love affair with their family’s gardener to be something much worse than what it is.

Her innocence and partial understanding of the world begins a chain of events that tears the family apart and alters the course of the rest of the girl’s life.<br><br>Sounds a little dry, right? Wrong! I guess I forgot to mention that the book was written by Ian McEwan, the king of uncomfortable moments, weird sex stuff, the rotating third-person close perspective, and - I’ll say it! - writing about the human psyche. While I’ve found some of his earlier books to be a little too uncomfortable (or, rather, too uncomfortable without good reason) or a little too sexually deviant (again, in the way that it seemed for shock value than with a reason), this was a freaking great book.<br><br>I think the one thing that makes this book so wonderful is McEwan’s eerily accurate understanding of how a 13-year-old girl’s mind works - her understanding of the world and her emotional reaction to it. Briony is trapped between childhood and adulthood. She’s old enough to recognize the dark and startling behind-the-scenes facets of her proper British family’s life, but not old enough to properly analyze or judge them. She’s old enough to impose her will and her ideas on others, but not wise enough to know when to act or when to question herself. It’s a frustrating and fascination (and uncomfortable) time, and he has it down pat.<br><br>McEwan also experiments with structure in ways that are truly innovative and new without being gimmicky. Briony is an aspiring writer who grows and develops her style throughout the 60 years that the novel covers, and McEwan’s novel mirrors her literary growth. Part One of the story is extremely traditional (broken into chapters, with a clear rotation of perspectives and a uniform chronology). Parts Two and Three are much more modern - the story, which switches gears to follow the gardener into WWII France and Briony to her experiences as a nurse in London, loses structure and fluidity and uses more modern storytelling techniques. Finally, the last section is utterly contemporary - the story becomes even more abstract, with unreliable narrators and more conceptual writing favored over simple narrative.<br><br>And yet these games with structure and story and perspective in no way take your focus from the story and the characters. Instead, they add to the experience of watching the main character grow and develop.<br><br>If the book suffers from anything, it might be a little slow in some places and move too fast in others. Since McEwan tends to be very thorough when it comes to interior thought, the story often slows down a bit more than it should so that he can explain how every single person felt about a certain moment in time (although the story spans 60 years, the first 200 pages span a single afternoon and evening). The slow story a necessary evil, though, if we want to keep the detailed character studies in place. And we do. And the action-filled second half of the book, which covers the British retreat from the Germans in 1940 and the over-capacity army hospitals of London, makes up for the sometimes austere and rigorous first half. It just takes a while to get the story rolling.<br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"6025545161893510223\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link9154704\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=9154704&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_9154704\"><a id=\"like_count_review_9154704\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/9154704?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">343 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/9154704?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_9154704\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/9154704/comments?reverse=true\">View all 16 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_5262878\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5262878\">\\n    <a title=\"Bart\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/210421-bart\"><img alt=\"Bart\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1547689631p2/210421.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/5262878?book_show_action=true\">Aug 28, 2007</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Bart\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Bart\" href=\"/user/show/210421-bart\">Bart</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n          <div><span class=\"uitext greyText\">Recommends it for: </span>\\n           <span class=\"uitext reviewText\">Literary fiction aficionados</span></div>\\n\\n        \\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer5262878\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer14986533704584695286\">That I can remember, I\\'ve never before disliked the start of a book so thoroughly, and by the end, gone on to think so much of it as a complete work.<br><br>The last 2/3 of this novel are as good as contemporary fiction gets.

The first 1/3 is like reading a Jane Austen plot trapped in amber.<br><br>As the title indicates <i>Atonement</i> is about a future artist\\'s massive effort to redeem herself for ruining the character of a young man when she is a younger girl. There are parts of this novel that are disjointed - or if they aren\\'t they appear so because the opening act moves so slowly that one is barely conscious and later unable to recall that anything much happened at all.<br><br>Halfway through this novel, when its greatness starts to happen, a reader almost laments his earlier opinions of it. But whose fault is that? The beginning is such an act of endurance that the later parts make a reader wish that McEwan had moved things more quickly in the beginning - and used those words for more character development in the middle - so the reader could declare this novel, unequivocally, one of the five best novels he\\'s ever read.<br><br>McEwan is at the top of the art form throughout, though, whatever a reader opines of the product. He knows what he\\'s doing every step of the way, right down to an allusion to the disjointed narrative methods employed by Virginia Woolf.<br><br>The ending is brilliant, unexpected and harsh. But unlike the case of the returning Baxter character in the third act of <i>Saturday</i>, this ending is consistent and at once surprising and inevitable.<br><br>After a person has read a few hundred novels, he grasps the art form well enough to know when an author is <i>writing</i> - usually it\\'s when the author\\'s employing some top-heavy descriptive technique that makes the water droplets gathered on a rose petal somehow more important than the protagonist\\'s motives for anything she\\'s done to that point - and it fairly well cries out, \"Look at me, my creator is a <i>writer</i>!\"<br><br>Knowing when an author is <i>writing</i> means knowing that if there\\'s a surprise coming, it\\'s either going to be predicted about 50 pages out or done in such fantastically poor form that its inconsistency mars the rest of the work.<br><br>McEwan is fine enough at his craft that the ending is both unanticipated and perfectly consistent. That alone makes this novel excellent.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"14986533704584695286\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link5262878\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=5262878&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_5262878\"><a id=\"like_count_review_5262878\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/5262878?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">329 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/5262878?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_5262878\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/5262878/comments?reverse=true\">View all 40 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_36216656\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/36216656\">\\n    <a title=\"Will Byrnes\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes\"><img alt=\"Will Byrnes\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1291462190p2/1526851.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/36216656?book_show_action=true\">Oct 25, 2008</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Will Byrnes\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Will Byrnes\" href=\"/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes\">Will Byrnes</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/1526851-will-byrnes?shelf=fiction\">fiction</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer36216656\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6829442565752109062\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1612498095i/30815064._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400” height=“xxx” alt=\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><i>Ian McEwan</i> - image from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette - photo credit: Joost van den Broek<br><br>I was bored with this until half way through, but then it got interesting.

First, the writer is one of its characters; second, because <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2408.Ian_McEwan\" title=\"Ian McEwan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ian McEwan</a>’s novel creates a world where subjectivity and objectivity interfere mutually. The characters are full of life and the language, even if elaborate and subtle, does not go around or makes inroads into itself.<br><br>The narrator and protagonist, Briony Tallis, emerges in the beginner as a pre-adolescent that dreams to arrange the world in her texts, as in the play she is writing. Her love for order, for the careful design according to her spoiled desires, is translated into an impulse to write that hardly depend on the theme. <br><br><b>\\n  <i>\\n    <blockquote>“There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn\\'t only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding, above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.”</blockquote>\\n  </i>\\n</b><br>Her cousins, Lola, and the twins will be the actors, with which she plans to awe the assembled family, that include her parents, her older sister Cecily and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. On that day of 1935, Briony sees Cecily and Robbie in a game that culminates in a fateful scene. Briony believes she sees something that profoundly perturbs her. The development of the story doesn’t let the reader stop. When, later, Lola is raped by a man that was not seen, Briony, without any grounds, makes a <i>‘deduction’</i> of who committed the crime.<br><br>Here we are, therefore, in the territory of Jane Austen, cited in the epigraph, or Henry James, George Eliot, and many other English authors: social tension versus sexual stress, pride and prejudice conflicts, mere misunderstandings that adopt dramatic dimensions. McEwan considers the simple distortions that physical acts, such as vision, can suffer when clouded by moral bias. Briony is attracted to Robbie and envies in Cecily her independence and, and in her anxiety to wipe out her shortcomings recreates the world in her own way, succumbing to prejudice and threatening her already reduced capacity to accept reality.<br><br>But, more than that, what McEwan shows is how a writer can worsen weaknesses such as vanity, cowardice and credulity, sentiments that derive from the solitary and fallible condition that is above all human. Briony, with an absent father, a sick mother, a distant brother and an adult sister, fills her solitude with words that want to arrange everything, as she organizes her room. <br><br><b>\\n  <i>\\n    <blockquote>“But hidden drawers, lockable diaries and cryptographic systems could not conceal from Briony the simple truth: she had no secrets. Her wish for a harmonious, organised world denied her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing. Mayhem and destruction were too chaotic for her tastes, and she did not have it in her to be cruel. Her effective status as an only child, as well as the relative isolation of the Tallis house, kept her, at least during the long summer holidays, from girlish intrigues with friends. Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel\\'s skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know.”</blockquote>\\n  </i>\\n</b><br>She is emotionally deprived as all of us, but a few degrees above the Richer scale: her need to be praised, her inability to deal with her environment, her surrendering to a fantasy of perfection – it is as if she were an immature child, seeking protection from life itself. <br><br>However, the novel goes beyond an intimate recounting. In the second half, McEwan throws the reader into the Second World War, with memorable descriptions of the United Kingdom’s empire ultimate whisper at the battle of Dunkirk. McEwan uses this as background to show us Robbie’s feelings. Among dead and wounded, he drifts with his head down and wrapped in his own sentiments to protect himself and to dream he will be exonerated for having survived in a battle where so many had died.<br><b>\\n  <i>\\n    <blockquote> “Now he reduced his progress to the rhythm of his boots -- he walked across the land until he came to the sea. Everything that impeded him had to be outweighed, even if only by a fraction, by all that drove him on. ...He knew by heart certain passages from her letters, he had revisited their tussle with the vase by the fountain, he remembered the warmth from her arm at the dinner when the twins went missing. These memories sustained him, but not so easily.”</blockquote>\\n  </i>\\n</b> But what rots and sustains him is his hate for Briony:<br><b>\\n  <i>\\n    <blockquote>“In that shrinking moment he discovered that he had never hated anyone until now. It was a feeling as pure as love, but dispassionate and icily rational.”</blockquote>\\n  </i>\\n</b>Above everything:<br><b>\\n  <i>\\n    <blockquote>“Let his name be cleared and everyone else adjust their thinking. He had put in time, now they must do the work. His business was simple. Find Cecilia and love her, marry her and live without shame.”</blockquote>\\n  </i>\\n</b>The ability of McEwan is very well known, but in <i>Atonement</i> he arrived were he had not reached before and where few living authors – maybe <i>Coetzee, Philip Roth</i> and a few others – were able to arrive. The force of his narrative comes from its plot and its magnitude as well as from its richness and structure. The story is strong, but who narrates is not subservient to its hierarchy and its rhythm: it’s a subject that lets it flow and, at the same time, chooses the moments and the way to reveal its parts. McEwan does not need to resort to fragmentation and mysticism to deal with the battle between affection and speech, tolerance and freedom, a clash so in evidence nowadays.<br>____</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"4582870599024763594\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link911157616\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=911157616&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_911157616\"><a id=\"like_count_review_911157616\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/911157616?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">155 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/911157616?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_911157616\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/911157616/comments?reverse=true\">View all 39 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1946113311\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1946113311\">\\n    <a title=\"Joey Woolfardis\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4639825-joey-woolfardis\"><img alt=\"Joey Woolfardis\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1490696206p2/4639825.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1946113311?book_show_action=true\">Mar 19, 2017</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Joey Woolfardis\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Joey Woolfardis\" href=\"/user/show/4639825-joey-woolfardis\">Joey Woolfardis</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"did not like it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">did not like it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9780099507383\" href=\"/book/show/1457100.Atonement\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=masculine\">masculine</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=bookshelf\">bookshelf</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=bloody-cack\">bloody-cack</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=ce21\">ce21</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=2017\">2017</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4639825-joey-woolfardis?shelf=sterling\">sterling</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1946113311\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer12000814212618635207\">Read as part of <a href=\"https://infiniteanddarling.co.uk/blogs/infinite-variety-books/the-infinite-variety-reading-challenge-part-one\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge</a>, based on the BBC\\'s Big Read Poll of 2003.<br><br><i>\\n  <b>The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.</b>\\n</i><br><br><b>In the heat of a 1930s Summer, a family reunites at their country home for what may be the last time.

Cousins have come to stay, a sister has returned from University and a brother is returning from America with a new friend in tow. Briony, the only child left at home, is furiously writing a play to be performed, but what she witnesses-and is exposed to-will force her to make a decision that she will regret for the rest of her life.</b><br><br>This book reminded me strongly of Evelyn Waugh, though I think that\\'s purely based on the surroundings and era (and mostly the house). Whilst Evelyn had a whimsical style to his writing, Ian McEwan is positively overflowing with flowery prose that leads nowhere and brings up memories of terrible books they made me read for college.<br><br><i>Atonement</i> is a relatively easy read, if you can take so much description and little plot. None of the characters are anything except a piece of personality and don\\'t go beyond their one trait and I felt nothing for all of them. They all had their one job and, whilst they did this one job well, that was that and there seemed nothing beyond their doing their one job.<br><br>We begin in a wonderful countryside house, which is described to death and the plot simmers along nicely. There\\'s a play being written, and the cousins coming down from the North are being forced to act it out. There is youthful petulance, coming-of-age rebellion and adults avoiding responsibility and, in truth, the scene is set nicely in the first few pages. But then this setting of the scene continues for around half the rest of the book and it soon becomes clear that the plot is far away and we\\'re not entirely sure if it\\'ll be seen at all.<br><br>Setting the book during the war seemed like a pointless endeavour, if only to include some kind of treacherous battle scenes to add to the overall lack of drama up to this point. I suppose the book needed to be set somewhere and some time, but the overall affect was unimpressive. I found the whole thing lacking, in truth. The book, whilst it shifted to another city and even country, was just too small. Everything was cloying and felt like it was happening in one tiny bubble. I prefer big worlds and big plots, not just a single thread moving through a mire.<br><br>The main thing that irritated me about this book, is that it was full of needless cliffhangers that were seemingly pointless to anything except to expunge the pathetic attempt at a plot beyond the story arc. Nearly every chapter ended with something along the lines of \"and oh my if this character hadn\\'t done what he\\'s about to do in the next chapter then his life would not have turned out the way it did\", as if McEwan is unsure of his plot and needs to plead with us to keep reading. \"What, what Ian, what\\'s going to happen? I must must <b>must</b> read on if you say something interesting is coming along, because so far we haven\\'t had much, have we, Sir?\"<br><br>I am grateful, however, at the vague pleasure I got from the book as I read it that kindled within me a notion of the kinds of books I do and do not like. I feel, having read this book, that I could spot a book I dislike from the first few pages now, whereas before I\\'d probably have to get through it all just to know. So, of course, I will now not be wasting more hours on books that seemingly go nowhere, even after the first half, than I need to.<br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.infiniteanddarling.co.uk/blogs/infinite-variety-books\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"http://amaranthinereads.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Reviews</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/infiniteANDdarling/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infinitedarlin\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"12000814212618635207\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link1946113311\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=1946113311&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_1946113311\"><a id=\"like_count_review_1946113311\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/1946113311?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">143 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/1946113311?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_1946113311\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/1946113311/comments?reverse=true\">View all 12 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_11457144\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/11457144\">\\n    <a title=\"Diane\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/279256-diane\"><img alt=\"Diane\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1497365060p2/279256.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/11457144?book_show_action=true\">Jan 02, 2008</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Diane\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Diane\" href=\"/user/show/279256-diane\">Diane</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/279256-diane?shelf=british-charm\">british-charm</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/279256-diane?shelf=movie-adaptation\">movie-adaptation</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/279256-diane?shelf=favorites\">favorites</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/279256-diane?shelf=gorgeous-prose\">gorgeous-prose</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/279256-diane?shelf=audiobooks\">audiobooks</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer11457144\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer2998969417938910505\">What a lovely reread this was!

If the answer was yes, then the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone’s thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone’s claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was. One could drown in irrelevance.\"<br><br>\"There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn\\'t only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding, above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.\"<br><br>\"At that moment, the urge to be writing was stronger than any notion she had of what she might write.\"<br><br>\"From this new and intimate perspective, she learned a simple, obvious thing she had always known, and everyone knew;

I am extremely ambivalent about this novel--first the pluses: the writing is gorgeous; McEwan has some of the best prose out there. Every line has meat to it, nothing is throwaway, and every visual is so vivid that the reader is transported to a specific time and place. Secondly, (what everyone praises the novel for), the commentary McEwan is making about the novel itself--the fact that it is written, that characters and plots are manipulated by the author, and how a real character emerges (eventually) while at the same a written story exists too. This is very difficult to write about without revealing anything about the plot, but as one reads the novel, it becomes clear what McEwan is trying to do. Finally, the references to other literature (including some of the best novels--Clarissa, Lolita--and novelists--Elizabeth Bowen is directly mentioned, Henry Green and Virginia Woolf are obvious influences) is fluid, never forced, and is done to showcase a love of literature. <br>At the same time, there are downsides to McEwan\\'s endeavor--how to write a novel that is commenting on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction), while at the same time trying to convey reality. This is perhaps an impossible task, and I\\'m left with the nagging feeling that the novel wants to have its cake and eat it too. The characters and situations are so obviously phony that it becomes distracting in the first part of the story. I was drawn in by the fantastic writing, but then found myself wanting to hurl the novel across the room at some of the ridiculous choices by both the characters and the novelist. Namely: 1) The main plot twist makes little realistic sense. Absolutely zero would fly in a mystery novel let alone real life; 2) The characters in the first part are boring aristocrats who we don\\'t care about (check out a Henry Green novel; except in his novels, the reader continues to laugh at them, there is no attempt at emotional attachment); 3) The \\'mystery\\'s\\' solution is obvious to the reader before the crime even happens; 4) Briony (part 1) is an insufferable narrator (as kid narrators, To Kill a Mockingbird excluded, so often are); 5) The novelist\\'s choice to name a sexually, precocious teenager \\'Lola\\' (too obvious a reference). But these choices are meant to be ridiculous--reality is only supposed to set in in the epilogue. At the same time, I marveled at how real parts 2 (Robbie at war) and 3 (Briony as a nurse--some of the hospital scenes are the best I\\'ve ever read) seemed to be. Then the question became for me--if they seemed real because of the way the scenes were written (the gore again in the hospital), but could not have been real because the characters and overall plot of the Tallis family are so fake, isn\\'t that cheating? I haven\\'t reached a conclusion yet, but something is still bugging me about the conception of it. Ultimately I prefer novels that go the opposite route--Paul Auster\\'s Oracle Night for example--that start out real and quickly become fake, or throw out the idea of a realistic, consistent plot entirely (only in the conclusion does David Mitchell\\'s Cloud Atlas come together), rather than the never-ending \\'is it real? is it fake?\\' push-and-pull of Atonement. </span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"5444208273471779151\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link11335656\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=11335656&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_11335656\"><a id=\"like_count_review_11335656\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/11335656?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">104 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/11335656?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_11335656\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/11335656/comments?reverse=true\">View all 8 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_11721739\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/11721739\">\\n    <a title=\"Allison\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/591409-allison\"><img alt=\"Allison\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1193865372p2/591409.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/11721739?book_show_action=true\">Jan 05, 2008</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Allison\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Allison\" href=\"/user/show/591409-allison\">Allison</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was ok\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was ok</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/591409-allison?shelf=fiction\">fiction</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer11721739\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6091071347141109926\">I feel that perhaps I have sabotaged this book somewhat as I read it directly after finishing Love In the Time of Cholera, and perhaps in retrospect should have read a poetry book or some non-fiction in between.

The details described in the book do a lot for physical surroundings but we know nothing of Cecila except she went to college and chain smokes, so I don\\'t particularly care about anything that happens to her, besides the fact that much of her life is lived outside what information the book provides. Briony is a terrible child, a narcissistic teenager, and and at last a harmless grandmother who I don\\'t especially care about at any of these three points in her life. The only character with the least bit of humanity seems to be Robbie who is still somewhat confined to his role as the \"victim\". All the lovely descriptions of ponds and hospital wards and French war-torn villages could not make up for the fact that none of these characters were the slightest bit interesting to me or seemed to connect to anything. They simply floated through long locational descriptions being powerless to the world around them and unfortunately for me I didn\\'t need 350 pages to get that point. It could have easily been accomplished as a short story or novella. I just kept feeling that the book had all this great detail but didn\\'t focus it on anything that it shoud have. <br><br>I know this may sound exceedingly harsh and once again I do chalk some of this up to reading Atonement directly after a much better novel it had no hope in eclipsing or even paralleling in its structure but I also know how quickly and easily I fall in love with characters. How quickly I can get pulled into a good story and I sincerely feel that although I wouldn\\'t call this book a complete waste, that my time would have been much better spent elsewhere.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"6091071347141109926\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link11721739\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=11721739&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_11721739\"><a id=\"like_count_review_11721739\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/11721739?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">103 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/11721739?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_11721739\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/11721739/comments?reverse=true\">View all 5 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_15552796\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/15552796\">\\n    <a title=\"Martine\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/381149-martine\"><img alt=\"Martine\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1189863081p2/381149.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/15552796?book_show_action=true\">Feb 16, 2008</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Martine\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Martine\" href=\"/user/show/381149-martine\">Martine</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=british\">british</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=film\">film</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=modern-fiction\">modern-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=family-drama\">family-drama</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=favourites\">favourites</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/381149-martine?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer15552796\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer14861658068928781429\">Having recently seen and loved the magnificent film adaptation, I decided to reread <i>Atonement</i>, which quite impressed me when it was first published.

And guess what? It was an even more rewarding experience the second time around. Knowing what was coming -- knowing the plot twist at the end -- helped me focus on the quality of the writing rather than on the development of the story, and as always, McEwan\\'s prose completely sucked me in. He is, quite simply, one of the most talented authors alive, and he uses his gift to great effect here.<br><br>I\\'m not really going to go into the plot here, because the less the first-time reader knows about the book, the better. Suffice it to say that it is about an imaginative thirteen-year-old who witnesses a few things she doesn\\'t understand, draws the wrong conclusions and ends up ruining the lives of two people near and dear to her. The first half of the book deals with the event itself and the hours leading up to it; the second half deals with her attempts to, well, deal with it -- atone for it, so to speak. <br><br>As always, McEwan excels at setting the scene. His description of a hot summer afternoon in a 1935 English country house is lush and sumptuous, his evocation of a young soldier\\'s struggle to reach home after the disastrous 1940 battle of Dunkirk is haunting, and his look into the horrors of a war-time London hospital is gruesome in all its detail. Amazingly, McEwan manages to find beauty even in the most horrific scenes, which is one of the things which set him apart as a writer. As usual, though, it\\'s the psychological stuff that is really outstanding. McEwan has a knack for taking his readers deep into his characters\\' minds, letting them share their most intimate, most uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. Sometimes these thoughts are a little disturbing (those of you who have read his earlier works will know what I mean), but usually they have the effect of completely drawing the reader into the story. The latter is definitely the case in <i>Atonement</i>. By presenting the story from different perspectives and vantage points, McEwan provides the reader with a complete and engrossing view of a life-changing event and its aftermath. All the different perspectives ring true, and together they tell a marvellous tale of perception, loyalty, anger, secrets, lost love, shame, guilt, obsession with the past and -- yes -- atonement. And about writing, for more than anything else, <i>Atonement</i> is about the difference between fiction and reality, the power of the imagination and the human urge to write and rewrite history -- to write destiny and play God.<br><br>I\\'ve heard quite a few people say that they found the first half of the novel too slow and ponderous, wondering why McEwan felt the need to devote nearly two hundred pages to the events of a single day. Personally, I found that part of the book to be utterly brilliant in its rich, Woolf-like glory. As far as I\\'m concerned, the atmosphere of the first half is superbly drawn, with each character down to the most minor one being well realised and the tensions and suspense at work almost being made tangible. For me, it is the second half of the book which has problems (albeit minor ones), in that I found the jumps in time and perspective jarring and the (otherwise fascinating) chapter about Robbie\\'s adventures in France somewhat unreal. Of course, there are good reasons for the slightly unreal quality of the Dunkirk chapter (which the film captured just brilliantly), but still, it didn\\'t quite work for me; it felt a bit out of place. Thankfully, though, the rest of the book worked just wonderfully for me. Like other McEwan books, it left me with a haunting question -- \\'What if...?\\'<br><br>As for McEwan\\'s impressive insight into the mind of a thirteen-year-old girl, which other reviewers have called scary, I think that has everything to do with Briony\\'s being a writer. She is hardly your average thirteen-year-old (I think even McEwan would have a hard time coming up with one of those!); rather she is a writer (a good one), and that, of course, is something McEwan knows all about. As a fellow writer, I greatly enjoyed seeing the world through Briony\\'s eyes, and hope her author will live to her old age and write as many good books as he has her doing.<br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"14861658068928781429\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link15552796\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=15552796&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_15552796\"><a id=\"like_count_review_15552796\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/15552796?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">91 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/15552796?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_15552796\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/15552796/comments?reverse=true\">View all 11 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_3738646981\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3738646981\">\\n    <a title=\"Nilufer Ozmekik\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik\"><img alt=\"Nilufer Ozmekik\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1606420322p2/53701594.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/3738646981?book_show_action=true\">Jan 03, 2021</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Nilufer Ozmekik\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Nilufer Ozmekik\" href=\"/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik\">Nilufer Ozmekik</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer3738646981\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer867288300705406295\">Wow!

I will embarrassedly share a personal secret. Actually it’s not personal! It’s about the actress and the bloody intense movie adaptation of this book. I am a big fan of charming Scottish Mr. McAvoy (In my opinion not Idi Amin but he’s the real king of Scotland!) so after watching so young but intimidating Saoirse Ronan as thirteen years old Briony Tallis and witnessed how she ruined her own sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley ) and Robbie ( played by magnificent McAvoy) the son of the servant, I started detesting the guts of that actress with every bone in my body! <br><br>After years I kept booing her at the theaters as soon as her frozen blue eyes appeared on the screen and I got kicked out from theaters! ( being thrown away like a garbage didn’t hurt my feelings but not watching the entire Lady Bird and Little Women adaptation of Greta Gerwig truly ached my heart! ) <br><br>Good things about this predicament: Even she was 13, Saoirse freaking Ronan was brilliant actress and the story of the book is heart wrenching, extra powerful and remarkable! It definitely broke my heart into tiny little pieces. <br><br> I skipped to read it for years because I knew deep in my heart the story would hurt me more when I got aged and just a little turned into a wiser woman. <br><br>But here I am, pulling out the band-aid! I got truly lost my mind in this remarkable journey which sets in three different time periods: 1935 England , during the time of Second World War between England and France and present England! <br><br> We’re introduced to thirteen year old Briony who witnesses her sister Cecilia and servant’s boy Robin’s flirtation which make her intrigued and jealous as well. Her reading wrongly of the actions and her misjudgment bring out a crime and ruins people’s lives! <br><br>I know she was just a young, naive, innocent girl but she paid throughout her life because one mistake she’s made! <br><br>That was the worst punishment to keep thinking about everything you’ve made differently through your entire life and putting this burden to young kid’s shoulder was a little cruel choice but that’s what makes the reading journey more angsty, emotional and effective! <br><br> I’m so happy to read the book and I’m so happy to make peace with Briony’s character as well! And I’m so relieved that I’m not gonna need to curse Saoirse Ronan when I see her face at the big screen! <br><br>Best quotes of the book: <br>“A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.” <br><br>“The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.”<br><br>“...falling in love could be achieved in a single word- a glance.”<br><br>“And though you think the world is at your feet, it can rise you up and tread on you.”<br><br>“How guilt refined the methods of self-torture, threading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.”<br><br>“But what really happened? The answer is simple: the lovers survive and flourish.”</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"867288300705406295\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link3738646981\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=3738646981&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_3738646981\"><a id=\"like_count_review_3738646981\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/3738646981?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">86 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/3738646981?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_3738646981\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/3738646981/comments?reverse=true\">View all 7 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1505506167\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1505506167\">\\n    <a title=\"Matthew\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/16254355-matthew\"><img alt=\"Matthew\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1464987365p2/16254355.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1505506167?book_show_action=true\">Jan 11, 2016</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Matthew\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Matthew\" href=\"/user/show/16254355-matthew\">Matthew</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Hardcover 9780385503952\" href=\"/book/show/9956.Atonement\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=2016\">2016</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=favorites\">favorites</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=library\">library</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=tear-jerkers\">tear-jerkers</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/16254355-matthew?shelf=completist-book-club\">completist-book-club</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1505506167\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6114967563168100540\">In life, we all make mistakes.

It\\'s beautiful, every word of it is gorgeous, but it\\'s as if the author spends all this time painstakingly crafting a really detailed, intricate vessel for you (I\\'m thinking of a boat :))and then just before your journey\\'s over he snatches it out from under you &amp; you sink. Why go to such lengths describing the lovers, and the war, and Briony &amp; the nursing when in the end none of it even matters? The problem with Atonement is that there is no atonement, which, of course, is the point. This book was described to me as \\'haunting\\' and it definitely is- haunting &amp; depressing. A story doesn\\'t have to have a happy ending to be good, I mean, this is a great book, really, but I felt really empty &amp; hollow when it was over. The part at the end when the author says that the story is the only part that matters b/c no one will ever remember the real people or the actual events anyway was crushing! It\\'s true, I know, and I don\\'t really have a problem w/ realism...but I have a big problem with death. It freaks me out. I have a really unhealthy fear of it. Especially unjust death. It just pisses me off more than I can explain. Maybe I\\'ve just been feeling too poetic lately, listening to too much sensitive-artist music, but I can\\'t stand that Briony kills 2 people and then just conjures them back up from the dead as if it never happened and no one else even mentions it. It makes me think too much about actual events, politics, &amp; things. I don\\'t want to run out of time, I have things I want to do here, and I don\\'t want to be reminded that the truth is it doesn\\'t matter whether I run out of time or not because eventually there isn\\'t going to be anyone left who ever knew me, or my family, or anyone we ever knew. Ugh. I\\'m making myself sick w/ this. I\\'m told the movie is really good b/c it\\'s beautiful w/out being quite as harsh at the end. I think I need to see it so I can stop thinking about the book. It\\'s waking me up at night, or rather it\\'s waking me up in the morning realizing that I\\'ve been thinking about it all night. I hate it, but it really is good.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"4934706602425033837\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n

to be part of the grown-ups\\' world, to want to understand their strange actions and their esoteric social codes, which seem so mysterious and sophisticated… As we get older we often realize that none of this is quite as glamorous as we had imagined, and the rear-view mirror of memory can give new meanings to events we thought we understood so well in our youth…<br><br>Briony is the youngest child of rather comfortable British family, between the two World Wars. One hot summer afternoon, when cousins and a friend of her older brother Leon\\'s are visiting, a strange series of events will change Briony\\'s life. She will witness a mysterious scene between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeeper\\'s son, Robbie; her thirteen years old eyes will interpret their interaction and the following events very differently from what actually happened and by the end of that day, nothing will ever be the same… From there on, we follow Robbie and Cecilia\\'s story, as they deal with the consequences of Briony\\'s not-so-innocent mistake, and with the young girl\\'s long and excruciating journey for forgiveness.<br><br>I am late on the band-wagon, as usual, and this is my first McEwan novel. And now I am kicking myself for not having checked this book out sooner. His prose is lush with gorgeous images and sensations - I found myself reading slower than usual to make the pleasure last a little bit longer. The characterization is amazing, as we get under every character\\'s skin, explore their thoughts, what haunts and motivates them - and it is captivating! McEwan\\'s mastery of language blew me away, as did his use of symbolism and clever narrative structure. A story about a mistake in judgement could never be told from a single point of view, it has to be explored from many angles, and he handled that with incredible skill.<br><br>What Briony does is a thoughtless act motivated by a whirlwind of immature feelings: jealousy, a need for attention, wanting to be taken seriously and feel \"worldly\", the budding fascination (and paradoxical repulsion) with sexuality that every young girl experiences... I\\'ve read many reviews that mention how much they hated her and how petty and selfish she was; have these readers ever met thirteen year old girls?! They are generally insufferable precisely because they are at that horribly awkward stage of growing up. Being a little girl doesn\\'t work anymore, but no one treats them like adults either, so they are unpredictable and they act out. I am by no means excusing Briony\\'s spiteful reaction; as the title of the book implies, she will spend the rest of her life paying for her mistake it in guilt and regret. What I am saying is how realistic I think she is; I didn\\'t like her one bit, but I believed in her completely.<br><br>I am not a big love story fan, because I think most people can\\'t write them up in any kind of honest and realistic way. Most people write about love-at-first sight or obsessive lust and neither of these things are love the way real people experience it, so I avoid books labeled as romances like the plague. I can count on the fingers of one hand the love stories I actually felt invested in, and Robbie and Cecilia\\'s story is one of them. This is impressive given the fact that they are each other\\'s first and only love, something I am usually very skeptical of. I was very moved by their devotion and how they give each other a reason to carry on in some of history\\'s darkest days. I read the second half of this book with a lump in my throat, wondering what was wrong with me. In the end, I realized that nothing is wrong with me: McEwan is just fucking brilliant.<br><br>Cecilia is spoiled, but she turns out to have more character and inner strength than the rest of her family put together. Her faith in Robbie and her unwavering loyalty to him made her one of the greatest romantic heroines I\\'ve encountered in literature. As for Robbie, I couldn\\'t help but admire his pride, his resilience and his fair-mindedness. For someone with such a bright and promising future to be disgraced and ruined the way he is would be tragic in and of itself, but the dignity with which he keeps moving and never gives up on his ultimate goal (to \"live without shame\": what a line!) made me root for him with my whole heart.<br><br>The ending made a lot of people angry, apparently, but I loved it. It made the heartbreaking parts of the story even more crushing and while we see that Briony can never really make peace with herself, she gave peace back to those she hurt the only way she could figure out how. I found that incredibly moving. Writing is a form of therapy to many writers: it\\'s a way to talk about the things that linger on your mind without really talking about them exorcise demons, right wrongs and create a better world. This novel made me want to start writing again.<br><br>This was a wonderful and rewarding read, a rich mix of Austen, Forster, Waugh and Woolf, and I loved every word of it so much more than I could have anticipated. I saw the movie, and while I often can\\'t stand the sight of Keira Knightley, I do think that she was a perfect Cecilia, and that the movie was a flawless adaptation that perfectly captured the tone of McEwan\\'s writing. 5 very bright stars and a spot of my \"favorites\" shelf.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"12674351355600112686\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link1830369824\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=1830369824&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_1830369824\"><a id=\"like_count_review_1830369824\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/1830369824?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">71 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/1830369824?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_1830369824\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/1830369824/comments?reverse=true\">View all 11 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1668231181\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1668231181\">\\n    <a title=\"Amalia Gkavea\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/56789747-amalia-gkavea\"><img alt=\"Amalia Gkavea\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1559158764p2/56789747.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1668231181?book_show_action=true\">Jun 14, 2016</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Amalia Gkavea\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Amalia Gkavea\" href=\"/user/show/56789747-amalia-gkavea\">Amalia Gkavea</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=favorites\">favorites</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=1930s\">1930s</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=classics\">classics</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=wwii-literature\">wwii-literature</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=1940s\">1940s</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=20th-century\">20th-century</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=british-literature\">british-literature</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=britain\">britain</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/56789747-amalia-gkavea?shelf=england\">england</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1668231181\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer5895326568459887415\"><i>\\n  <b>“How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?

I\\'m totally sure that had her idle time been shortened by at least 50%, there wouldn\\'t have been any grounds for the debacle. She would\\'ve been taught to distinguish between fantasy and actual stuff (don\\'t tell me she was too young for it, kids as young as 3-4 can do that perfectly fine!) and that would\\'ve at least given her a chance to distinguish between her maniac perceptions and what she actually saw. As it was, she was half-mad with her fantastic thinking and was very far removed from real life. <br><br>So, considering that I believe that the whole premise is ludicrous and the bunch of these MCs need a shrink and some sensible activities to do, I\\'m looking at the plot and thinking it\\'s dreadful. <br>I definitely dislike all the other reviewers\\' arguments about how she was a kid and didn\\'t know what she was doing. Since, what does that really mean? What, every kid now has a free pass to go and destroy some lives? That\\'s why kids don\\'t vote, because they might not know what they are doing. And that\\'s why they need upbringing and education and medical help (incl. psychiatric, if needed). <br><br>The sex-rape-id-thing. What the hell was everyone thinking? A not-very-stable not-so-little girl accuses a boy of a rape and they just lap it up! How could she have seen his face in the dark?<br>And what was her fragging deal? She was quite old to bother people into playing out her horrible plays? Isn\\'t she then old enough to maybe think a bit in a straight way?! <br><br>I think Robbie\\'s just not very well-written. It\\'s just as if the author wanted him to be a shade of some general partially randomized boy. You know, to give the general idea of all the wrongfully-accused young men who, well, got into mess not of their own making?<br>Or is that the author just showing us that large chunks of the story are just Briony making all this stuff up as some sort of self-therapy? If so, how very nice for her. <br><br>Basically, the only really fleshed out character is Briony. The rest read like ghosts: moth-like, we\\'ve got names, we\\'ve got them doing things but they are transparent. Likely that\\'s the author letting us feel that we are seeing things second-hand with Briony\\'s eyes.<br><br>The atonement: None for anyone. We don\\'t enter the same river twice: we may only dream about it.<br>One can be sad with Briony not getting her chances but damn, the 1st part was such a stupid plot twist. On the chances:<br>- she didn\\'t get her memo for not making stuff up and subsequently, no chance for actual atonement for her / by her. Some things you can\\'t take back so best to tread carefully all along.<br>- quite a lot of characters didn\\'t get the chance to live and love at all.&nbsp;Even the several years that were allotted to them before war: yes, to Robbie and Cecilia.<br>B. basically robbed them of their&nbsp;whole lives: while war wasn\\'t of her making, the aftermath of the rape debacle for the 2 of them was. And, as destiny would have it, that was all that there was to be. Until B\\'s tender mercies.<br><br>Briony being a l\\'enfant terrible:<br>Q:<br>She was one of those children possessed by a desire to have the world just so. Whereas her big sister’s room was a stew of unclosed books, unfolded clothes, unmade bed, unemptied ashtrays, Briony’s was a shrine to her controlling demon: (c) Dratt. This girl just has too much of free time on her hands. They should\\'ve just gotten her to do something useful with all that extra energy: study Chinese, go and train to become an Olympic-grade skater, study physics for science career... You know: useful stuff.<br>Q:<br>Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel’s skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know. (c) <br><br>Briony\\'s social skills are pretty much nonexistent. Kudos to McIan for getting how children can sometimes think but drat, that\\'s horrible to follow. She actually tries to rope her cousins into a play rehearsals no more than 6 minutes after their arrival. She doesn\\'t even have the slightest idea that maybe some people would hate the idea of participating in a play. Why did no one stop (even for a bit) to discuss with her how other people might feel? Kids can be especially dumb when it comes to other people. I\\'m pretty sure she had no idea that other people might have personal lives out of her censoring.<br>And her interaction with Lola?<br>Q:<br>Briony struggled to grasp the difficult thought, wasn’t there manipulation here, wasn’t Lola using the twins to express something on her behalf, something hostile or destructive? Briony felt the disadvantage of being two years younger than the other girl, of having a full two years’ refinement weigh against her, and now her play seemed a miserable, embarrassing thing. …<br>she proceeded to outline the plot, even as its stupidity began to overwhelm her. (c) Well, it was a miserable thing. Who are we kidding? <br><br>Briony\\'s very egoistic from the start and she seems to be very much in love with her older brother. What\\'s it with McEwan and incest themes? Well, at least this time around the incest is more of a subconscious longing than action plan.<br>Q:<br>She was not playing Arabella because she wrote the play, she was taking the part because no other possibility had crossed her mind, because that was how Leon was to see her, because she was Arabella. (c) God, she was Arabella? She was supposed to demonstrate to her bro that he should marry a nice girl she approves of. And then what, because of her cousins\\' freckles, now she is Arabella? <br><br>Melodramatic much?<br>Q:<br>As she saw the dress make its perfect, clinging fit around her cousin and witnessed her mother’s heartless smile, Briony knew her only reasonable choice then would be to run away, to live under hedges, eat berries and speak to no one, and be found by a bearded woodsman one winter’s dawn, curled up at the base of a giant oak, beautiful and dead, and barefoot, or perhaps wearing the ballet pumps with the pink ribbon straps… (c) <br>Anyway, what\\'s Briony\\'s deal that even after all the time, plays seem to remain her only instrument of self-expression?<br><br>Q:<br>I was elated and urgently wanted to tell my closest friends.(c) That\\'s Briony rejoicing on the vascular dementia news. Isn\\'t she still a drama queen?&nbsp;<br><br>Other fun ideas:<br>Q:<br>It was not generally realised that what children mostly wanted was to be left alone.

Is there anything really wrong with Ian McEwan\\'s “Atonement?” Is it not a compelling story well told? Is the writing not clear, succinct, and free of pretentiousness? Does McEwan not draw the reader into a well-imagined world and hold him there until the last page? The answer to all these questions is yes. Yet still, yet still...<br><br>Maybe it\\'s all the acclaim that “Atonement” received when first published and the literary prizes it either won or was shortlisted for, or maybe it\\'s the comparison I\\'m drawing – unfairly, to be sure – with some of the classic novels I\\'ve been reading lately, but I just don\\'t see why McEwan\\'s book has been held up as one of the great works of literary fiction of recent years. (Or maybe everything else from the last several years is that much worse?) My chief problem with “Atonement” is it just never feels fully real, like great novels do. I could never picture Briony, Cecilia, Robbie and the book\\'s other characters existing beyond their words and actions on the page. They never become something more than characters in a novel – never become real living, breathing people, as is the case with truly great works of literature. The whole book just feels far too mannered, too neatly composed, too written.<br><br><i>Spoilers to follow here, so skip the next paragraph if you haven\\'t yet read “Atonement” and plan to.</i><br><br>Does this maybe speak, though, to McEwan\\'s genius? After all, in his nod to the art of metafiction, McEwan makes the novel not really his novel at all, but rather one written by his character Briony Tallis, so that all but the last section of the book, which is told first-person by Briony, becomes a novel within the novel. A defender of the book who accepts everything I\\'ve said up until this point might rightfully argue that the novel-within-the-novel\\'s weaknesses speak to the who the character of Briony actually is, and to her shortcomings as a novelist. If that were McEwan\\'s intention, it\\'s kind of a brilliant move: a good novelist purposely writing in an average way because the character actually telling the story is herself an average novelist. OK, but even if I accept this argument – and even though I made the argument myself, I\\'m not sure it holds water – I still don\\'t want to read an entire novel that\\'s simply average, even if it\\'s intended to be.<br><br><i>Spoilers over.</i><br><br>Getting back to my original point, though, why do I feel the urge to demand that every piece of literature – even one well-loved, and with critical regard – need be as brilliant as one by, say, Nabokov? (Though, to be fair, McEwan is asking for this comparison, as Nabokov mastered the metafiction toyed with in “Atonement” back when McEwan was just a wee lad.) Can\\'t some literary novels just be an enjoyable read without achieving a place in the pantheon of great literature? Isn\\'t there, alongside Nabokov and Bellow, a place for writers such as John Irving and Ian McEwan? (And is that too insulting to McEwan? Too flattering to Irving?) And, finally, have I become, as a reader, too much a curmudgeon?<br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"8769544932005644839\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link58221419\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=58221419&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_58221419\"><a id=\"like_count_review_58221419\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/58221419?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">57 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/58221419?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_58221419\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/58221419/comments?reverse=true\">View all 32 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_305423837\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/305423837\">\\n    <a title=\"Kim\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4542979-kim\"><img alt=\"Kim\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1454402751p2/4542979.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/305423837?book_show_action=true\">Apr 02, 2012</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Kim\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Kim\" href=\"/user/show/4542979-kim\">Kim</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Kindle Edition \" href=\"/book/show/5324495-atonement\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4542979-kim?shelf=buddy-reads-with-jemidar\">buddy-reads-with-jemidar</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer305423837\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer2902056227905179983\"><br>This was the favourite novel of a friend of mine who died suddenly a few years ago.

Although I\\'ve only seen it once, I can still see images: Cecilia\\'s green dress and the beach at Dunkirk particularly come to mind. I also remembered the plot, and therefore its twist. So when I read the novel, there were no suprises. Knowing what was going to happen, I paid attention to see if I could pick up the clues and yes, they were there in the text. Not that I think a reader who didn\\'t know the plot could work it all out just on the basis of the clues, but at least McEwan wasn\\'t cheating. <br><br>Anyway, while I don\\'t think McEwan is ever going to be my favourite novelist. There\\'s a brittleness to him (or something, I\\'m not quite sure what it is) that I find unappealing. However, in this novel he poses important questions about love, guilt, redemption, truth and the nature and purpose of fiction. McEwan writes excellent prose and he does the meta-fiction thing extremely well. I doubt I\\'ll be reading this again, but I\\'m glad that I\\'ve read it once. Now I understand why my friend loved it so much. I just wish she was still here so we could talk about it.<br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"2902056227905179983\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link305423837\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=305423837&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_305423837\"><a id=\"like_count_review_305423837\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/305423837?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">56 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/305423837?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_305423837\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/305423837/comments?reverse=true\">View all 8 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_858318341\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/858318341\">\\n    <a title=\"Violet wells\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4196681-violet-wells\"><img alt=\"Violet wells\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1442260743p2/4196681.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/858318341?book_show_action=true\">Feb 18, 2014</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Violet wells\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Violet wells\" href=\"/user/show/4196681-violet-wells\">Violet wells</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4196681-violet-wells?shelf=booker\">booker</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4196681-violet-wells?shelf=contemporary-british-fiction\">contemporary-british-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4196681-violet-wells?shelf=21st-century\">21st-century</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4196681-violet-wells?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer858318341\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6277404148214305070\">Atonement is a post-modernist interpretation of historical fiction.

And how narrative itself is a selective process – brilliantly exposed here when Robbie sends the wrong letter to Cecelia. <br> The atmospheric ideal drift of life on a country estate replete with overly familial class divisions quotes early/middle 20th century historical fiction themes with a slightly troubling fidelity to clichéd tropes. For a while it’s almost as if McEwan has gone soft in his old age. But it’s as if he is working his way through 20th century British literature in this novel whose subject, beneath the ostensible one of guilt and atonement, is essentially narrative itself. To the clichéd backdrop of the country estate he brings in Virginia Woolf’s floating impressionistic technique of creating biography, Lawrence’s use of the repressed sex instinct as plot crucible and catalyst and Forster’s showdown moment in the Maribor cave when deep seated submerged prejudice and crowd contagion convince everyone of guilt. It’s almost as if McEwan is playfully writing himself into British literary history. <br><br>The second part is all gritty realism – a high definition account of the brutalities of war. One effect of war is to scramble formerly sustaining narratives. This is what happens to both Robbie and Briony. His experience of blame and hers of guilt change. War provides Briony with the possibility of atonement in the form of self-sacrifice and bullies Robbie into understanding that holding one individual to account for his wretched fate is absurd. Both begin to construct a new narrative, no more true perhaps than the former. Because this is a novel about the enormous power but, at bottom, creative inauthenticity of narrative. We believe in what it is necessary for us to believe. <br></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"6277404148214305070\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link858318341\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=858318341&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_858318341\"><a id=\"like_count_review_858318341\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/858318341?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">58 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/858318341?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_858318341\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/858318341/comments?reverse=true\">View all 13 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1222604615\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1222604615\">\\n    <a title=\"Nandakishore Mridula\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula\"><img alt=\"Nandakishore Mridula\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1583648733p2/6237864.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1222604615?book_show_action=true\">Mar 09, 2015</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Nandakishore Mridula\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Nandakishore Mridula\" href=\"/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula\">Nandakishore Mridula</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9780099507383\" href=\"/book/show/1457100.Atonement\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1222604615\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer12073026303177983162\">I watched the movie before reading the book, which was probably a mistake because I loved the movie and I felt that the book didn\\'t measure up.

Some word beyond \\'enthralling\\'? I need them. I\\'m reaching for them. But I literally just finished the book and I\\'m so much in awe of it I just can\\'t. It\\'s perfect. It\\'s perfect in every image and line and mirror and echo. Ian McEwan is such a master of language and storycraft.<br><br>I devoured this book in a day. Less than a day. Ignoring all other work to do so. And it was TOTALLY worth it. <br><br>I can\\'t think of what to praise first this point, so I\\'m going to go in random order. I\\'ll start with the language. It\\'s enthralling. It\\'s that that draws you into the story. The story moves rather slowly, really. Half of the book takes place on a single day. But it is the language that makes you not care. The wordchoice is enchanting, just so. Gorgeous imagery interposed with just the right touch of magic to keep it beautifully fresh. He weaves his images throughout the text, having them pop up again and again, subtly. For instance, a pair of boy\\'s pajamas becomes a symbol of war and horror as well as innocence ruined and then vague oppression and doubt renewed throughout the novel. A finger becomes a sense of self and changed identity at various points. It\\'s just gorgeously done.<br><br>The storycraft is so perfect too. I love how he chooses to do it, switching from perspective to perspective, but always with the center on this delusional little girl, and the echoes of her own storymaking. It is story that screws over them all in the end. But it is story that resurrects them too. I loved his inward musings on writing, and his critique of his own writing within the text. It\\'s a bit of a breaking of the fourth wall that\\'s done with a rather sad irony, but it still brought a smile to my face.<br><br>I really enjoyed the themes that he explored too. Eventually I\\'ll post some of my favorite quotes to give an idea of the beauty of the language and ideas that he explores as well, but in general... I think my favorite idea that he dealt with was the idea of order as a kind of childishness. As a kind of little, small denial of the world. The entire book shows the folly of order and what it does to our souls and minds. (quotes to come on this). I also loved his treatment of the all consuming nature of guilt. Atonement. Atonement indeed.<br><br>Amazing.

Sometimes the end can make a book and that is certainly the case here where the story is left open for interpretation. This is a book that leaves you thinking and considering, making up your own conclusions--and strong enough characters to make you want to.<br><br>The first few chapters I did find my mind wandering through lengthy descriptions (I\\'ll call it beautiful, poetic scenery), and yet that scenery set a lackadaisical feel vital to the innocence and peace of that opening day. It\\'s not just the easy-going feel of pre-war life McEwan was portraying. On a second read, I find a strain, a desire to understand every motive and action. And in those details I find sadness that life never moved on. It was played over and over again trying to find meaning and purpose to each detail. The slowness is painstaking analysis. There is a reason for the meticulous care with which each detail is described and the read well worth the persistence to the end.<br><br>Even from the beginning I was intrigued with the story and found the characters compelling. I just loved Briony\\'s capricious character, her innocent yet eloquently advanced mind. I could despise the nosy little sister and sympathize with the fearful inactive girl all in one breath. I could hate Paul\\'s conceit and Lola\\'s pleas for attention and understand the muteness all the same. But mostly I could sympathize and relate to Robbie and Cecilia as likable characters, wanting to add more time to their brief, interrupted interactions. I found myself ever-fearful for the end and therefore could not put the book down.<br><br>Spoilers in my analysis to death.<br>Despite Briony\\'s foreshadowing (saying she would rewrite the fountain scene from all perspectives), I did not suspect the end. I expected the separation but not the invention of this whole story. Because of the story in a story format, you can interpret the few authentic scenes anyway you like and not take her word for any of it. That is what I love about the story, particularly on a second read, that I can question motives assigned to characters instead of take it for face value. At one point reading Robbie\\'s thoughts I considered the layers: Ewan writing Briony writing Robbie and paused in awe at McEwan\\'s talent. <br><br>Because of the layers, McEwan has the unique opportunity to add insight and symbolism, even study questions as commentary. Take Briony\\'s comment when relieved to see Robbie at Cecilia\\'s that Robbie\\'s death would have been \"outlandish, against all odds\" and would have made no sense. Or the letter from the editor telling her the story was incomplete: \"how might [her misunderstanding:] affect the lives of the two adults?\" And while vivid her descriptions of light and shade she should create \"light and shade within the narrative itself.\" To which you can\\'t help but wonder about light and shade in the story and characters. In what other novel can the author analyze his own work and insert his own cues for study?<br><br>I was confused at the drastic abbreviation of Robbie\\'s war tour--though I enjoyed considering the shrapnel as a physical expression of his hidden wound. It was so obvious why the section quit there, but I couldn\\'t believe it ended there; I had to hold out hope however thin the thread. I thought Briony\\'s atonement would come as a nurse on duty, and I held my breath waiting for the improbable meeting. Her interaction with the dying French boy showed how much she wanted that redemption from Robbie by consoling and listening to what cannot be fixed. How she longed for closure with him. <br><br>I doubt Robbie hated Briony. In her self-deprecation her interpretation is harsh. I think exasperation at a nosy child whom you adore but all of a sudden can\\'t approach because her vivid imagination has turned to fear is sufficient emotion. I liked Robbie enough to think he could have forgiven her. If anything he was the one who was understanding and forgiving while Cecilia was ready to throw out her family to show her commitment to Robbie. I think Cecilia and Robbie were on the verge of forgiving Briony, but Briony could not allow herself to believe so without diminishing her guilt. She states \"neither Briony nor the war had destroyed\" their love. Even though she says so about her made-up gift of an ending, can\\'t she see some redemptive power for herself, even in the \"bleakest realism\"? <br><br>I was so confused at the unexpected way the reunion scene between Robbie and Celia. It was so implausible and awkward and I wondered how the story had gotten off course and how Robbie had gotten there from France. His reaction was not anything like I expected, that after everything he had been through, he could still hold that much hate for Briony. And yet that was its intention. On a second read, it\\'s one of my favorite parts as she gives us a glimpse of the verbal rebut she so longed for and some of the best layered meanings. I love how her novel sprouted from a desire to amend, but offered as a response to Robbie\\'s invented request: \"She knew what was required of her...a new draft, an atonement.\" <br><br>While Briony should take culprit for the loss of several years, she can\\'t for their entire lives, for the years fate and the war stole away. And she can\\'t even take full credit for those years. It was not her \"crime\" but her interpretation of one that fueled the problem. She spent her life in remorse, letting her decision shape her life and self worth. I think she more than paid her debt for what was a misunderstanding, a mistake, not cruel revenge. She got caught up in her perception and forced facts to fit her assumptions--ones she full-heartedly believed. <br><br>It is Lola unwilling to admit her part in the sexual encounter that should be atoning. Paul with his unrepentant spirit that should atone for another man paying for his crime. And even her mother making the improbable leap from inappropriate love letter to assault to break a servant\\'s son connection with her daughter. Surely, she is just as guilty but seems unwillingly to accept her part in losing relationships with both her daughters. Briony is the only one in this story willing to atone for the tragedy. I didn\\'t find her silence at the wedding cowardice: what good would it have served to ruin yet another couple\\'s happiness? Her appearance was sufficient.<br><br>I wish Cecilia were more vocal the night they waited for his return. Sure the social class and unacceptable library behavior restrained her, but I wanted passion as proof of her love. Her silence annoyed and confused me as much as Briony\\'s self-righteous witness angered me. But despite her hesitation that night, considering Cecilia\\'s drastic reaction to her family, I want to believe the relationship must have been long-term, more serious. I\\'d like to think as her atonement Briony was as hard on herself as possible. I want to think that instead of unrequited love there was secret love undiscovered away from home but unable to pass inquisitive eyes. It doesn\\'t atone, but it makes it less severe. <br><br>Briony\\'s initial reaction to the fountain scene was that Robbie was proposing marriage. It could be accurate that Briony happened upon a lover\\'s quarrel: Cecilia wanted to keep the relationship hushed from her parents and when Robbie was too personal in broad daylight she snapped. The letter could have been a joke from a guy asking for a moment alone with his girlfriend and in it his hesitance to jump from playful to committed. The story invented, while the most probable, was the most severe option she could conjure up and not the one I wanted to believe. I know I\\'m grasping at straws, but I want to believe Briony was wrong. The beauty of the story is I can.<br><br>The fact that I cared enough about the characters to want that for them, to simmer over it after I closed the book, reluctant to have it end, testifies to the power of the story. Despite my longing, I wouldn\\'t necessarily consider the story of Robbie and Cecilia a complete tragedy. If one had survived to grieve and hate then yes, but to have such intense love (to have \"a reason for life\" as Cecilia put it) and be reunited after a short time gives their lives meaning and purpose and only makes it tragic for Briony left to regret the consequences of her rash judgment without ever hope of reconciliation. There in lies the tragedy: in a girl\\'s life altered, not in the love story.<br>Some of my favorite quotes:<br>It wasn\\'t only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter there different minds and show how they had a equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.<br>The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.<br>(Robbie of meeting Cecilia) It would be worse, but he still wanted it. he had to have it. He wanted it to be worse. <br>Every now and then quite unintentionally someone taught you something about yourself.<br>(Robbie &amp; Cecilia uttering each other\\'s names) It sounded like a new word--the syllables remained the same, the meaning was different.<br>(Briony on guilt) How quite refined the methods of self-torture, invading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.<br>Memories--bleached colorless through overuse.<br>With the clarity of passion<br>A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.<br>She was the sort of girl who lived in her thoughts.<br>It was common enough to see so much death and want a child, common therefore human, and he wanted it all the more. When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere, of an ordinary life, a family line, connection.<br>Now was her chance to proclaim in public all the private anguish and purge herself of all that she had done wrong. Before the altar of this most rational of churches.<br>To Briony it appeared her life was gong to be lived in one room without a door.<br>What she felt was more like homesickness though there was no source for it, no home. </span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"13066508187119939013\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link15268691\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=15268691&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_15268691\"><a id=\"like_count_review_15268691\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/15268691?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">51 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/15268691?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_15268691\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/15268691/comments?reverse=true\">View all 5 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1011185011\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1011185011\">\\n    <a title=\"Duane\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/24389390-duane\"><img alt=\"Duane\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1403316391p2/24389390.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1011185011?book_show_action=true\">Jul 30, 2014</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Duane\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Duane\" href=\"/user/show/24389390-duane\">Duane</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"it was amazing\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was amazing</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=2014-book-challenge\">2014-book-challenge</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=5-star-books\">5-star-books</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=english-calssics\">english-calssics</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=rated-books\">rated-books</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=21st-century\">21st-century</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=reviewed-books\">reviewed-books</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/24389390-duane?shelf=guardian-1000\">guardian-1000</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1011185011\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer16770515338019762391\">When I read a contemporary 21st century novel, especially a really good one, I often wonder, will it become a classic?

All her plans were ruined by her rude cousins who fought with her. Sad, she begins to wander around her house, with her thoughts. She spots her elder sister Cecilia and their cleaning lady\\'s son Robbie in a situation she cant comprehend. Her vivid, wild imagination prompts her to immediately write a story. She thinks that Robbie has set his mind to do something evil and she needs to protect her sister.<br><br>When a family tragedy occurs, Briony decides to take charge and accuse Robbie of a crime he has not committed. This turns the life of a lot of people upside down. As Briony grows up, she realises that she has made a mistake. The rest of the novel is about how she tries to atone her mistake and whether she succeeds or not.<br><br>What I loved about this book:<br><br>Character development: Even though the initial chapters were boring, McEwan has done a great job in writing the thoughts and perspectives of each character. The thoughts of Briony who wants to be a writer, the anguish of an ill mother when she thinks about her daughters, the thoughts and actions of Robbie and Cecilia.. All these were written with perfection.<br><br>Conclusion: As heartbreaking as it was, this is the point in which the novel turned from an average book to a spectacular one.<br><br>Originality of Plot: The story idea was original and realistic.<br><br>Things that disappointed me:<br><br>Beginning: It was dragging. I guess it needs editing. Those initial chapters were required to build the story, but they needn\\'t be so lengthy.<br><br>Part 2: After the story started moving, the book was really interesting. But when I reached part 2, I just didnt understand why it needed to be so long and it felt so disconnected from part 1.<br><br>Portrayal of Briony: I believe that Briony was almost innocent, considering her age and what she witnessed. But all through the book, I felt McEwan was trying to portray her as someone evil and mischievous. The young villain of the story. But her motives were honest and just. I dont know why the police and investigators didnt do a good job. They could have asked where each of the characters where during the search. <br><br>*Spoiler Alert*<br>( An afterthought on this point. Maybe Briony was portrayed as a lying, unreliable witness and a cruel girl by the author because she is the writer of the story and it\\'s all that she can do under the given circumstances: make herself look like the bad guy, as a small penance for ruining the lives of her sister and Robbie.)<br><br>Missing pieces: I wish McEwan had written a bit more about the interrogation and what was going through the minds of each of the family members after the \"tragedy\". Also how Cecilia acted after the arrest of Robbie. <br><br>That\\'s all I can think about now! I\\'m eager to hear the thoughts and opinions of other readers about this book😊!!<br><br>Watched the movie and loved it. This is one of the few books in which I found the movie adaptation more interesting than the book.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"2298016227698728543\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n\\n  \\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link2965597165\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=2965597165&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_2965597165\"><a id=\"like_count_review_2965597165\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/2965597165?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">54 likes</span></a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F6867.Atonement\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/2965597165?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_2965597165\" style=\"display: none;\">\\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/2965597165/comments?reverse=true\">View all 8 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\">\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_1840044997\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1840044997\">\\n    <a title=\"Charlotte May\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/14002983-charlotte-may\"><img alt=\"Charlotte May\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1596906925p2/14002983.jpg\"></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/1840044997?book_show_action=true\">Dec 19, 2016</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Charlotte May\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Charlotte May\" href=\"/user/show/14002983-charlotte-may\">Charlotte May</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars notranslate\" title=\"really liked it\"><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">really liked it</span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9780099507383\" href=\"/book/show/1457100.Atonement\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=tear-jerker\">tear-jerker</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=historical-fiction\">historical-fiction</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=classics\">classics</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=sisters\">sisters</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=war\">war</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/14002983-charlotte-may?shelf=favourites\">favourites</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer1840044997\" class=\"readable\">\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer17824298081687695544\">Atonement is an incredible story of ignorance and youth.<br>Younger sister Briony catches her sister in the thralls of a passionate embrace - being unsure of the meaning of this situation it leads her to accuse a young man of one of the most hideous acts.<br>The story follows the three characters as they lead separate lives, forever tainted by this one accusation.

Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.\\\\n\\\\nWithin the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.\\\\n\\\\nNever Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"12294272818812015888\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'8_book_6334\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"4w8n0rXovyMeDLftxQU3l5A46nhXlRHzsp82cYOMl9ewQKfXhOrUHz9Kuim0ODx2/6dAA3PObK5BZtvucj1bzw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6334\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"8_book_6334\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"3kJ3C7em3HfFyaFglroRrd/LENv321VJWNy/L9U9oUeNDfcOhqS3S+SPrKTnhxpMsFS6oNOAKBSrJVKwJIxtXw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"8_book_6334\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6334\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, Middlesex is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"9842146572925937054\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'10_book_2187\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"Mge3+wwqobLATRx1i6OdzqVYLNT0fZrnJV7d9yLmz3NhSDf+PSjKjuELEbH6npYvyseGr9Am57rWpzBo01cDaw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"2187\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"10_book_2187\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"00k9PlgnBV7VCTIPGCkX4VRooSO2pZ+oe9w/jP4XazKABr07aSVuYvRPP8tpFBwAO/cLWJL+4vWIJdITD6anKg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"10_book_2187\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"2187\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives - the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness - are inextricable from the history playing out around them.\\\\n\\\\nPropelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love - a stunning accomplishment.\\\\n--front flap<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"10567335319141491669\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'15_book_128029\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"fqCpwlP6cL8CsXcib+3SujlMXlMTOI1mzDo4SPPw2uYt7ynHYvgbgyP3euYe0NlbVtP0KDdj8Ds/w9XXAkEW/g==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"128029\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"15_book_128029\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"kNbDz5hdqiMMVBiubZ8BWpkKpGyqg0zF8jo77XKqQZ/DmUPKqV/BHy0SFWocogq79pUOF47YMZgBw9ZygxuNhw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"15_book_128029\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"128029\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther\\\\\\'s breakdown with such intensity that Esther\\\\\\'s insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"14011635241984082254\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'16_book_6514\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"bVjuMlbFq79xp0DhFPNeRK8yiS9aIL+r/GbC03I4CGo+F243Z8fAg1DhTSVlzlWlwK0jVH57wvYPny9Mg4nEcg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6514\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16_book_6514\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"nzmtB39xhULf/44UcXZjwj+R2fCLeCdB+VtNnUiI/7rMdi0CTnPufv65g9AAS2gjUA5zi68jWhwKoqACuTkzog==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16_book_6514\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6514\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful - and completely unforgettable.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"16108573128768008362\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'17_book_929\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"F7Sc9o1sqiJ02T0FTLqBo63otxQPR/L0vBId+TblbhRE+xzzvG7BHlWfMME9h4pCwncdbyscj6lP6/Bmx1SiDA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"929\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"17_book_929\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"JOtJswy0faEfn5abFmhTtRil1IQSJ7rjW9dqu16ceVB3pMm2PbYWnT7Zm19nVVhUdzp+/zZ8x76oLockry21SA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"17_book_929\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"929\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

At once a love story &amp; a harrowing account of one man’s long walk home, Cold Mountain introduces a new talent in American literature.\\\\n\\\\nBased on local history &amp; family stories passed down by Frazier’s great-great-grandfather, Cold Mountain is the tale of a wounded Confederate soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war &amp; back home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. His odyssey thru the devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with Ada’s struggle to revive her father’s farm, with the help of an intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman &amp; Ada confront the vastly transformed world they’ve been delivered.\\\\n\\\\nFrazier reveals insight into human relations with the land &amp; the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great 19th century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. Cold Mountain recreates a world gone by that speaks to our time.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"11787408588740987265\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'20_book_10920\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"hxfmVl0EHNFWIBESh8AaUwU666wsqH1eK+bEp9OedGXUWGZTbAZ37XdmHNb2/RGyaqVB1wjzAAPYHyk4Ii+4fQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"10920\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"20_book_10920\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"iVr2lyQ+wSqMohKbq0ivwLGsFjEOIsZ8BEN5PSrk5/baFXaSFTyqFq3kH1/adaQh3jO8Sip5uyH3upSi21Ur7g==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"20_book_10920\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"10920\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

style=\\\\\"display:none\\\\\">Winner of the National Book Award for FictionNominated for the National Book Critics Circle AwardAn American Library Association Notable BookJonathan Franzen\\\\\\'s third novel, The Corrections, is a great work of art and a grandly entertaining overture to our new century: a bold, comic, tragic, deeply moving family drama that stretches from the Midwest at mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of greed and globalism. Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With The Corrections, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it\\\\\\'s the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson\\\\\\'s disease, or maybe it\\\\\\'s his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn\\\\\\'t seem to understand a word Enid says.Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid\\\\\\'s children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a &quot;transgressive&quot; lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband\\\\\\'s growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"17974811759611456981\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'21_book_3805\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"BFOwHecOhKEDnLA6Dxtl2VicHUL/LzA3UMaR9ZyEiMdXHDAY1gzvnSLavf5+Jm44NwO3Odt0TWqjP3xqbTVE3w==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"3805\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"21_book_3805\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"pid2W1v/sPbI20voMQrKCCX7/FHGlpo7P+IndPpeiN/1aPZeav3byumdRixAN8HpSmRWKuLN52bMG8rrC+9Exw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"21_book_3805\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"3805\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer\\\\\\'s extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier\\\\\\'s second novel of the same title.\\\\n\\\\nGirl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer\\\\\\'s prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel\\\\\\'s quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"7860851785678370782\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'22_book_2865\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"g8WHBFnpnTCsc2nDp7wY7xNJNCQ+MMyVu0G89t977l7QigcBaOv2DI01ZAfWgRMOfNaeXxprschIuFFpLsoiRg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"2865\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"22_book_2865\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"o/teOo4S+HgNGWhXmZEVd+XbRab2JjySwG9fjdn006XwtN4/vxCTRCxfZZPorB6WikTv3dJ9Qc8zlrISKEUfvQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"22_book_2865\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"2865\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

As the young Englishman Stephen Wraysford passes through a tempestuous love affair with Isabelle Azaire in France and enters the dark, surreal world beneath the trenches of No Man\\\\\\'s Land, Sebastian Faulks creates a world of fiction that is as tragic as A Farewell to Arms and as sensuous as The English Patient. Crafted from the ruins of war and the indestructibility of love, Birdsong is a novel that will be read and marveled at for years to come.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"1600683653763943385\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'24_book_6259\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/rdkfQrp0H9Aihw2taaN/v5eUgNwz/kFtYUM49HY8Xyt+OR4O+u7Q2HMEfLEm4YfkcH4eFSUhFhGfOF8IGk9ZA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6259\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"24_book_6259\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"WRcwmxbEQkIY7OllT+Au/MlK2GjVfjwuSZqfm2SFUnQKWLCeJ8Ypfjmq5KE+3SUdptVyE/ElQXO6Y3IElTSebA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"24_book_6259\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"6259\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/73612.UK_100_Books_to_Read_in_a_Lifetime_Readers_Picks\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/6867.Atonement\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

      "There are many reviews already of this book, and I did wonder whether the world needed any more. But I disagree so strongly with some of the opinions expressed that I'm afraid I have to exercise my right to reply. Two things in particular stand out. Let me deal with the simpler one first. Some people seem appalled that the author is putting the guilt for this dreadful tragedy on the shoulders of a young girl. She didn't know what she was doing, they say; she was too young to understand the import of her actions, and we shouldn't hold her responsible. Well, it seems to me that this is completely beside the point. The novel, we finally learn, has been written by the girl herself. She's giving herself the blame for what happened. She's evidently spent her whole life wondering why she behaved the way she did, and she still doesn't really know. She's just trying to get the story as straight as she can, mainly so that she can understand it herself, and I found her efforts extremely moving. If anyone is claiming that people don't behave this way, all I can say is that their view of human nature is so different from mine that it'll be hard to have a meaningful conversation on the subject. So now the second and more controversial part. Many reviewers dislike the post-modernist aspects. They complain that McEwan is taking a perverse pleasure in tricking the reader into a view of the story which is finally revealed as incorrect; that he's playing the unreliable narrator card out of sheer willfulness. Again, I completely disagree. I don't think these aspects of the book are irrelevant or peripheral; I think they're at the very core of it, and are what make it a great piece of literature. McEwan shows us a girl who becomes an author precisely because she wants to expiate the dreadful feelings of guilt she has suffered all her life. He lets her explain how it happened, in what we eventually discover is a book within a book. And the truly awful thing is that she can't do it. She cops out with a fake happy ending, because she still can't face what she did.I don't think this is a trick; I think he's saying something about the very nature of writing. Many, many writers are like Briony. They write to absolve themselves of their guilt, but in the end they don't say what they want to say. It's too horrible to write down. They skirt around the issues, and end up presenting them in a more favourable light. If they're lucky, they may finally reach an age when they are so far removed from what happened that they can tell the story straight. This is what Briony does in the postscript, and I don't find it far-fetched. To take just one example, the first I happen to think of, look at Marguerite Duras. All her life, she kept thinking about her first love affair, and it coloured most of what she wrote. It was only when she was nearly 70 that she could set it down as L'Amant.Before the events of the fountain, Briony was indeed just a little girl; all she could write was the amusingly mediocre Arabella. Afterwards, she had something that was worth saying, though it took a long time to figure out how to do that. When she'd completed her task, she was able to get back to the one she was engaged in when she was interrupted: I love the circular structure, which ends with Arabella being staged 60 years late. Of the many infuriating changes in the movie version, I think I was most annoyed by the removal of this key scene.Wood burns, observes Monty Python's logician, as he gives an example of an incorrect syllogism; therefore, all that burns is wood. Similarly, the fact that much trickery is post-modern does not imply that all post-modernism is trickery. This is a great and heart-felt novel.\n",

      "In World War II England, 13-year-old Briony Tallis misinterprets her older sister’s love affair with their family’s gardener to be something much worse than what it is. Her innocence and partial understanding of the world begins a chain of events that tears the family apart and alters the course of the rest of the girl’s life.Sounds a little dry, right? Wrong! I guess I forgot to mention that the book was written by Ian McEwan, the king of uncomfortable moments, weird sex stuff, the rotating third-person close perspective, and - I’ll say it! - writing about the human psyche. While I’ve found some of his earlier books to be a little too uncomfortable (or, rather, too uncomfortable without good reason) or a little too sexually deviant (again, in the way that it seemed for shock value than with a reason), this was a freaking great book.I think the one thing that makes this book so wonderful is McEwan’s eerily accurate understanding of how a 13-year-old girl’s mind works - her understanding of the world and her emotional reaction to it. Briony is trapped between childhood and adulthood. She’s old enough to recognize the dark and startling behind-the-scenes facets of her proper British family’s life, but not old enough to properly analyze or judge them. She’s old enough to impose her will and her ideas on others, but not wise enough to know when to act or when to question herself. It’s a frustrating and fascination (and uncomfortable) time, and he has it down pat.McEwan also experiments with structure in ways that are truly innovative and new without being gimmicky. Briony is an aspiring writer who grows and develops her style throughout the 60 years that the novel covers, and McEwan’s novel mirrors her literary growth. Part One of the story is extremely traditional (broken into chapters, with a clear rotation of perspectives and a uniform chronology). Parts Two and Three are much more modern - the story, which switches gears to follow the gardener into WWII France and Briony to her experiences as a nurse in London, loses structure and fluidity and uses more modern storytelling techniques. Finally, the last section is utterly contemporary - the story becomes even more abstract, with unreliable narrators and more conceptual writing favored over simple narrative.And yet these games with structure and story and perspective in no way take your focus from the story and the characters. Instead, they add to the experience of watching the main character grow and develop.If the book suffers from anything, it might be a little slow in some places and move too fast in others. Since McEwan tends to be very thorough when it comes to interior thought, the story often slows down a bit more than it should so that he can explain how every single person felt about a certain moment in time (although the story spans 60 years, the first 200 pages span a single afternoon and evening). The slow story a necessary evil, though, if we want to keep the detailed character studies in place. And we do. And the action-filled second half of the book, which covers the British retreat from the Germans in 1940 and the over-capacity army hospitals of London, makes up for the sometimes austere and rigorous first half. It just takes a while to get the story rolling.\n",

      "That I can remember, I've never before disliked the start of a book so thoroughly, and by the end, gone on to think so much of it as a complete work.The last 2/3 of this novel are as good as contemporary fiction gets. The first 1/3 is like reading a Jane Austen plot trapped in amber.As the title indicates Atonement is about a future artist's massive effort to redeem herself for ruining the character of a young man when she is a younger girl. There are parts of this novel that are disjointed - or if they aren't they appear so because the opening act moves so slowly that one is barely conscious and later unable to recall that anything much happened at all.Halfway through this novel, when its greatness starts to happen, a reader almost laments his earlier opinions of it. But whose fault is that? The beginning is such an act of endurance that the later parts make a reader wish that McEwan had moved things more quickly in the beginning - and used those words for more character development in the middle - so the reader could declare this novel, unequivocally, one of the five best novels he's ever read.McEwan is at the top of the art form throughout, though, whatever a reader opines of the product. He knows what he's doing every step of the way, right down to an allusion to the disjointed narrative methods employed by Virginia Woolf.The ending is brilliant, unexpected and harsh. But unlike the case of the returning Baxter character in the third act of Saturday, this ending is consistent and at once surprising and inevitable.After a person has read a few hundred novels, he grasps the art form well enough to know when an author is writing - usually it's when the author's employing some top-heavy descriptive technique that makes the water droplets gathered on a rose petal somehow more important than the protagonist's motives for anything she's done to that point - and it fairly well cries out, \"Look at me, my creator is a writer!\"Knowing when an author is writing means knowing that if there's a surprise coming, it's either going to be predicted about 50 pages out or done in such fantastically poor form that its inconsistency mars the rest of the work.McEwan is fine enough at his craft that the ending is both unanticipated and perfectly consistent. That alone makes this novel excellent.\n",

The characters are full of life and the language, even if elaborate and subtle, does not go around or makes inroads into itself.The narrator and protagonist, Briony Tallis, emerges in the beginner as a pre-adolescent that dreams to arrange the world in her texts, as in the play she is writing. Her love for order, for the careful design according to her spoiled desires, is translated into an impulse to write that hardly depend on the theme. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding, above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her cousins, Lola, and the twins will be the actors, with which she plans to awe the assembled family, that include her parents, her older sister Cecily and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. On that day of 1935, Briony sees Cecily and Robbie in a game that culminates in a fateful scene. Briony believes she sees something that profoundly perturbs her. The development of the story doesn’t let the reader stop. When, later, Lola is raped by a man that was not seen, Briony, without any grounds, makes a ‘deduction’ of who committed the crime.Here we are, therefore, in the territory of Jane Austen, cited in the epigraph, or Henry James, George Eliot, and many other English authors: social tension versus sexual stress, pride and prejudice conflicts, mere misunderstandings that adopt dramatic dimensions. McEwan considers the simple distortions that physical acts, such as vision, can suffer when clouded by moral bias. Briony is attracted to Robbie and envies in Cecily her independence and, and in her anxiety to wipe out her shortcomings recreates the world in her own way, succumbing to prejudice and threatening her already reduced capacity to accept reality.But, more than that, what McEwan shows is how a writer can worsen weaknesses such as vanity, cowardice and credulity, sentiments that derive from the solitary and fallible condition that is above all human. Briony, with an absent father, a sick mother, a distant brother and an adult sister, fills her solitude with words that want to arrange everything, as she organizes her room. \n",
      "\n",
      "“But hidden drawers, lockable diaries and cryptographic systems could not conceal from Briony the simple truth: she had no secrets. Her wish for a harmonious, organised world denied her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing. Mayhem and destruction were too chaotic for her tastes, and she did not have it in her to be cruel. Her effective status as an only child, as well as the relative isolation of the Tallis house, kept her, at least during the long summer holidays, from girlish intrigues with friends. Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel's skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She is emotionally deprived as all of us, but a few degrees above the Richer scale: her need to be praised, her inability to deal with her environment, her surrendering to a fantasy of perfection – it is as if she were an immature child, seeking protection from life itself. However, the novel goes beyond an intimate recounting. In the second half, McEwan throws the reader into the Second World War, with memorable descriptions of the United Kingdom’s empire ultimate whisper at the battle of Dunkirk. McEwan uses this as background to show us Robbie’s feelings. Among dead and wounded, he drifts with his head down and wrapped in his own sentiments to protect himself and to dream he will be exonerated for having survived in a battle where so many had died.\n",
      "\n",
      " “Now he reduced his progress to the rhythm of his boots -- he walked across the land until he came to the sea. Everything that impeded him had to be outweighed, even if only by a fraction, by all that drove him on. ...He knew by heart certain passages from her letters, he had revisited their tussle with the vase by the fountain, he remembered the warmth from her arm at the dinner when the twins went missing. These memories sustained him, but not so easily.”\n",
      "\n",
      " But what rots and sustains him is his hate for Briony:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that shrinking moment he discovered that he had never hated anyone until now. It was a feeling as pure as love, but dispassionate and icily rational.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Above everything:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let his name be cleared and everyone else adjust their thinking. He had put in time, now they must do the work. His business was simple. Find Cecilia and love her, marry her and live without shame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ability of McEwan is very well known, but in Atonement he arrived were he had not reached before and where few living authors – maybe Coetzee, Philip Roth and a few others – were able to arrive. The force of his narrative comes from its plot and its magnitude as well as from its richness and structure. The story is strong, but who narrates is not subservient to its hierarchy and its rhythm: it’s a subject that lets it flow and, at the same time, chooses the moments and the way to reveal its parts. McEwan does not need to resort to fragmentation and mysticism to deal with the battle between affection and speech, tolerance and freedom, a clash so in evidence nowadays.____\n",

      "The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.\n",
      "In the heat of a 1930s Summer, a family reunites at their country home for what may be the last time. Cousins have come to stay, a sister has returned from University and a brother is returning from America with a new friend in tow. Briony, the only child left at home, is furiously writing a play to be performed, but what she witnesses-and is exposed to-will force her to make a decision that she will regret for the rest of her life.This book reminded me strongly of Evelyn Waugh, though I think that's purely based on the surroundings and era (and mostly the house). Whilst Evelyn had a whimsical style to his writing, Ian McEwan is positively overflowing with flowery prose that leads nowhere and brings up memories of terrible books they made me read for college.Atonement is a relatively easy read, if you can take so much description and little plot. None of the characters are anything except a piece of personality and don't go beyond their one trait and I felt nothing for all of them. They all had their one job and, whilst they did this one job well, that was that and there seemed nothing beyond their doing their one job.We begin in a wonderful countryside house, which is described to death and the plot simmers along nicely. There's a play being written, and the cousins coming down from the North are being forced to act it out. There is youthful petulance, coming-of-age rebellion and adults avoiding responsibility and, in truth, the scene is set nicely in the first few pages. But then this setting of the scene continues for around half the rest of the book and it soon becomes clear that the plot is far away and we're not entirely sure if it'll be seen at all.Setting the book during the war seemed like a pointless endeavour, if only to include some kind of treacherous battle scenes to add to the overall lack of drama up to this point. I suppose the book needed to be set somewhere and some time, but the overall affect was unimpressive. I found the whole thing lacking, in truth. The book, whilst it shifted to another city and even country, was just too small. Everything was cloying and felt like it was happening in one tiny bubble. I prefer big worlds and big plots, not just a single thread moving through a mire.The main thing that irritated me about this book, is that it was full of needless cliffhangers that were seemingly pointless to anything except to expunge the pathetic attempt at a plot beyond the story arc. Nearly every chapter ended with something along the lines of \"and oh my if this character hadn't done what he's about to do in the next chapter then his life would not have turned out the way it did\", as if McEwan is unsure of his plot and needs to plead with us to keep reading. \"What, what Ian, what's going to happen? I must must must read on if you say something interesting is coming along, because so far we haven't had much, have we, Sir?\"I am grateful, however, at the vague pleasure I got from the book as I read it that kindled within me a notion of the kinds of books I do and do not like. I feel, having read this book, that I could spot a book I dislike from the first few pages now, whereas before I'd probably have to get through it all just to know. So, of course, I will now not be wasting more hours on books that seemingly go nowhere, even after the first half, than I need to.Blog | Reviews | Instagram | Twitter\n",

      "This is where a 2.5 star rating would be ideal. I am extremely ambivalent about this novel--first the pluses: the writing is gorgeous; McEwan has some of the best prose out there. Every line has meat to it, nothing is throwaway, and every visual is so vivid that the reader is transported to a specific time and place. Secondly, (what everyone praises the novel for), the commentary McEwan is making about the novel itself--the fact that it is written, that characters and plots are manipulated by the author, and how a real character emerges (eventually) while at the same a written story exists too. This is very difficult to write about without revealing anything about the plot, but as one reads the novel, it becomes clear what McEwan is trying to do. Finally, the references to other literature (including some of the best novels--Clarissa, Lolita--and novelists--Elizabeth Bowen is directly mentioned, Henry Green and Virginia Woolf are obvious influences) is fluid, never forced, and is done to showcase a love of literature. At the same time, there are downsides to McEwan's endeavor--how to write a novel that is commenting on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction), while at the same time trying to convey reality. This is perhaps an impossible task, and I'm left with the nagging feeling that the novel wants to have its cake and eat it too. The characters and situations are so obviously phony that it becomes distracting in the first part of the story. I was drawn in by the fantastic writing, but then found myself wanting to hurl the novel across the room at some of the ridiculous choices by both the characters and the novelist. Namely: 1) The main plot twist makes little realistic sense. Absolutely zero would fly in a mystery novel let alone real life; 2) The characters in the first part are boring aristocrats who we don't care about (check out a Henry Green novel; except in his novels, the reader continues to laugh at them, there is no attempt at emotional attachment); 3) The 'mystery's' solution is obvious to the reader before the crime even happens; 4) Briony (part 1) is an insufferable narrator (as kid narrators, To Kill a Mockingbird excluded, so often are); 5) The novelist's choice to name a sexually, precocious teenager 'Lola' (too obvious a reference). But these choices are meant to be ridiculous--reality is only supposed to set in in the epilogue. At the same time, I marveled at how real parts 2 (Robbie at war) and 3 (Briony as a nurse--some of the hospital scenes are the best I've ever read) seemed to be. Then the question became for me--if they seemed real because of the way the scenes were written (the gore again in the hospital), but could not have been real because the characters and overall plot of the Tallis family are so fake, isn't that cheating? I haven't reached a conclusion yet, but something is still bugging me about the conception of it. Ultimately I prefer novels that go the opposite route--Paul Auster's Oracle Night for example--that start out real and quickly become fake, or throw out the idea of a realistic, consistent plot entirely (only in the conclusion does David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas come together), rather than the never-ending 'is it real? is it fake?' push-and-pull of Atonement. \n",

      "I feel that perhaps I have sabotaged this book somewhat as I read it directly after finishing Love In the Time of Cholera, and perhaps in retrospect should have read a poetry book or some non-fiction in between. Clearly anything I would have read after finishing a Masterpiece would pale in comparison but I decided that the critical raves this book had received and high praise from people around me should be enough to encourage me to see it through to the end.Here is why I found this book lacking without giving too much actual plot away to those who would want to read it themselves.I found all of the characters completely devoid of any true personality or any reason I should care or feel connected to them. The details described in the book do a lot for physical surroundings but we know nothing of Cecila except she went to college and chain smokes, so I don't particularly care about anything that happens to her, besides the fact that much of her life is lived outside what information the book provides. Briony is a terrible child, a narcissistic teenager, and and at last a harmless grandmother who I don't especially care about at any of these three points in her life. The only character with the least bit of humanity seems to be Robbie who is still somewhat confined to his role as the \"victim\". All the lovely descriptions of ponds and hospital wards and French war-torn villages could not make up for the fact that none of these characters were the slightest bit interesting to me or seemed to connect to anything. They simply floated through long locational descriptions being powerless to the world around them and unfortunately for me I didn't need 350 pages to get that point. It could have easily been accomplished as a short story or novella. I just kept feeling that the book had all this great detail but didn't focus it on anything that it shoud have. I know this may sound exceedingly harsh and once again I do chalk some of this up to reading Atonement directly after a much better novel it had no hope in eclipsing or even paralleling in its structure but I also know how quickly and easily I fall in love with characters. How quickly I can get pulled into a good story and I sincerely feel that although I wouldn't call this book a complete waste, that my time would have been much better spent elsewhere.\n",

Very clever!One of our protagonists, Robbie, puts his lustful thoughts to paper in a way that would merely seem vulgarly juvenile in a modern-day text message: Been dreamin' bout kissing your c**t, yeah?But when inscribed in ink, onto 1930s vellum stationery, the \"C\" word is both shocking and ruinous. There is no doubt that McEwan is one of Britain's greatest literary gods, his beautiful prose had me purrrring with delight ... Ah, but here's the thing...The story. Nnnng, grmmmphh!Oh, it just didn't keep me enthralled. There, I've said it!

      "Having recently seen and loved the magnificent film adaptation, I decided to reread Atonement, which quite impressed me when it was first published. And guess what? It was an even more rewarding experience the second time around. Knowing what was coming -- knowing the plot twist at the end -- helped me focus on the quality of the writing rather than on the development of the story, and as always, McEwan's prose completely sucked me in. He is, quite simply, one of the most talented authors alive, and he uses his gift to great effect here.I'm not really going to go into the plot here, because the less the first-time reader knows about the book, the better. Suffice it to say that it is about an imaginative thirteen-year-old who witnesses a few things she doesn't understand, draws the wrong conclusions and ends up ruining the lives of two people near and dear to her. The first half of the book deals with the event itself and the hours leading up to it; the second half deals with her attempts to, well, deal with it -- atone for it, so to speak. As always, McEwan excels at setting the scene. His description of a hot summer afternoon in a 1935 English country house is lush and sumptuous, his evocation of a young soldier's struggle to reach home after the disastrous 1940 battle of Dunkirk is haunting, and his look into the horrors of a war-time London hospital is gruesome in all its detail. Amazingly, McEwan manages to find beauty even in the most horrific scenes, which is one of the things which set him apart as a writer. As usual, though, it's the psychological stuff that is really outstanding. McEwan has a knack for taking his readers deep into his characters' minds, letting them share their most intimate, most uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. Sometimes these thoughts are a little disturbing (those of you who have read his earlier works will know what I mean), but usually they have the effect of completely drawing the reader into the story. The latter is definitely the case in Atonement. By presenting the story from different perspectives and vantage points, McEwan provides the reader with a complete and engrossing view of a life-changing event and its aftermath. All the different perspectives ring true, and together they tell a marvellous tale of perception, loyalty, anger, secrets, lost love, shame, guilt, obsession with the past and -- yes -- atonement. And about writing, for more than anything else, Atonement is about the difference between fiction and reality, the power of the imagination and the human urge to write and rewrite history -- to write destiny and play God.I've heard quite a few people say that they found the first half of the novel too slow and ponderous, wondering why McEwan felt the need to devote nearly two hundred pages to the events of a single day. Personally, I found that part of the book to be utterly brilliant in its rich, Woolf-like glory. As far as I'm concerned, the atmosphere of the first half is superbly drawn, with each character down to the most minor one being well realised and the tensions and suspense at work almost being made tangible. For me, it is the second half of the book which has problems (albeit minor ones), in that I found the jumps in time and perspective jarring and the (otherwise fascinating) chapter about Robbie's adventures in France somewhat unreal. Of course, there are good reasons for the slightly unreal quality of the Dunkirk chapter (which the film captured just brilliantly), but still, it didn't quite work for me; it felt a bit out of place. Thankfully, though, the rest of the book worked just wonderfully for me. Like other McEwan books, it left me with a haunting question -- 'What if...?'As for McEwan's impressive insight into the mind of a thirteen-year-old girl, which other reviewers have called scary, I think that has everything to do with Briony's being a writer. She is hardly your average thirteen-year-old (I think even McEwan would have a hard time coming up with one of those!); rather she is a writer (a good one), and that, of course, is something McEwan knows all about. As a fellow writer, I greatly enjoyed seeing the world through Briony's eyes, and hope her author will live to her old age and write as many good books as he has her doing.\n",

      "Wow! I will embarrassedly share a personal secret. Actually it’s not personal! It’s about the actress and the bloody intense movie adaptation of this book. I am a big fan of charming Scottish Mr. McAvoy (In my opinion not Idi Amin but he’s the real king of Scotland!) so after watching so young but intimidating Saoirse Ronan as thirteen years old Briony Tallis and witnessed how she ruined her own sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley ) and Robbie ( played by magnificent McAvoy) the son of the servant, I started detesting the guts of that actress with every bone in my body! After years I kept booing her at the theaters as soon as her frozen blue eyes appeared on the screen and I got kicked out from theaters! ( being thrown away like a garbage didn’t hurt my feelings but not watching the entire Lady Bird and Little Women adaptation of Greta Gerwig truly ached my heart! ) Good things about this predicament: Even she was 13, Saoirse freaking Ronan was brilliant actress and the story of the book is heart wrenching, extra powerful and remarkable! It definitely broke my heart into tiny little pieces.  I skipped to read it for years because I knew deep in my heart the story would hurt me more when I got aged and just a little turned into a wiser woman. But here I am, pulling out the band-aid! I got truly lost my mind in this remarkable journey which sets in three different time periods: 1935 England , during the time of Second World War between England and France and present England!  We’re introduced to thirteen year old Briony who witnesses her sister Cecilia and servant’s boy Robin’s flirtation which make her intrigued and jealous as well. Her reading wrongly of the actions and her misjudgment bring out a crime and ruins people’s lives! I know she was just a young, naive, innocent girl but she paid throughout her life because one mistake she’s made! That was the worst punishment to keep thinking about everything you’ve made differently through your entire life and putting this burden to young kid’s shoulder was a little cruel choice but that’s what makes the reading journey more angsty, emotional and effective!  I’m so happy to read the book and I’m so happy to make peace with Briony’s character as well! And I’m so relieved that I’m not gonna need to curse Saoirse Ronan when I see her face at the big screen! Best quotes of the book: “A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.” “The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.”“...falling in love could be achieved in a single word- a glance.”“And though you think the world is at your feet, it can rise you up and tread on you.”“How guilt refined the methods of self-torture, threading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.”“But what really happened? The answer is simple: the lovers survive and flourish.”\n",

Why go to such lengths describing the lovers, and the war, and Briony & the nursing when in the end none of it even matters? The problem with Atonement is that there is no atonement, which, of course, is the point. This book was described to me as 'haunting' and it definitely is- haunting & depressing. A story doesn't have to have a happy ending to be good, I mean, this is a great book, really, but I felt really empty & hollow when it was over. The part at the end when the author says that the story is the only part that matters b/c no one will ever remember the real people or the actual events anyway was crushing! It's true, I know, and I don't really have a problem w/ realism...but I have a big problem with death. It freaks me out. I have a really unhealthy fear of it. Especially unjust death. It just pisses me off more than I can explain. Maybe I've just been feeling too poetic lately, listening to too much sensitive-artist music, but I can't stand that Briony kills 2 people and then just conjures them back up from the dead as if it never happened and no one else even mentions it. It makes me think too much about actual events, politics, & things. I don't want to run out of time, I have things I want to do here, and I don't want to be reminded that the truth is it doesn't matter whether I run out of time or not because eventually there isn't going to be anyone left who ever knew me, or my family, or anyone we ever knew. Ugh. I'm making myself sick w/ this. I'm told the movie is really good b/c it's beautiful w/out being quite as harsh at the end. I think I need to see it so I can stop thinking about the book. It's waking me up at night, or rather it's waking me up in the morning realizing that I've been thinking about it all night. I hate it, but it really is good.\n",

      "Ah, to be young and bookish and to hate your status as a child… To want to be part of the grown-ups' world, to want to understand their strange actions and their esoteric social codes, which seem so mysterious and sophisticated… As we get older we often realize that none of this is quite as glamorous as we had imagined, and the rear-view mirror of memory can give new meanings to events we thought we understood so well in our youth…Briony is the youngest child of rather comfortable British family, between the two World Wars. One hot summer afternoon, when cousins and a friend of her older brother Leon's are visiting, a strange series of events will change Briony's life. She will witness a mysterious scene between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeeper's son, Robbie; her thirteen years old eyes will interpret their interaction and the following events very differently from what actually happened and by the end of that day, nothing will ever be the same… From there on, we follow Robbie and Cecilia's story, as they deal with the consequences of Briony's not-so-innocent mistake, and with the young girl's long and excruciating journey for forgiveness.I am late on the band-wagon, as usual, and this is my first McEwan novel. And now I am kicking myself for not having checked this book out sooner. His prose is lush with gorgeous images and sensations - I found myself reading slower than usual to make the pleasure last a little bit longer. The characterization is amazing, as we get under every character's skin, explore their thoughts, what haunts and motivates them - and it is captivating! McEwan's mastery of language blew me away, as did his use of symbolism and clever narrative structure. A story about a mistake in judgement could never be told from a single point of view, it has to be explored from many angles, and he handled that with incredible skill.What Briony does is a thoughtless act motivated by a whirlwind of immature feelings: jealousy, a need for attention, wanting to be taken seriously and feel \"worldly\", the budding fascination (and paradoxical repulsion) with sexuality that every young girl experiences... I've read many reviews that mention how much they hated her and how petty and selfish she was; have these readers ever met thirteen year old girls?! They are generally insufferable precisely because they are at that horribly awkward stage of growing up. Being a little girl doesn't work anymore, but no one treats them like adults either, so they are unpredictable and they act out. I am by no means excusing Briony's spiteful reaction; as the title of the book implies, she will spend the rest of her life paying for her mistake it in guilt and regret. What I am saying is how realistic I think she is; I didn't like her one bit, but I believed in her completely.I am not a big love story fan, because I think most people can't write them up in any kind of honest and realistic way. Most people write about love-at-first sight or obsessive lust and neither of these things are love the way real people experience it, so I avoid books labeled as romances like the plague. I can count on the fingers of one hand the love stories I actually felt invested in, and Robbie and Cecilia's story is one of them. This is impressive given the fact that they are each other's first and only love, something I am usually very skeptical of. I was very moved by their devotion and how they give each other a reason to carry on in some of history's darkest days. I read the second half of this book with a lump in my throat, wondering what was wrong with me. In the end, I realized that nothing is wrong with me: McEwan is just fucking brilliant.Cecilia is spoiled, but she turns out to have more character and inner strength than the rest of her family put together. Her faith in Robbie and her unwavering loyalty to him made her one of the greatest romantic heroines I've encountered in literature. As for Robbie, I couldn't help but admire his pride, his resilience and his fair-mindedness. For someone with such a bright and promising future to be disgraced and ruined the way he is would be tragic in and of itself, but the dignity with which he keeps moving and never gives up on his ultimate goal (to \"live without shame\": what a line!) made me root for him with my whole heart.The ending made a lot of people angry, apparently, but I loved it. It made the heartbreaking parts of the story even more crushing and while we see that Briony can never really make peace with herself, she gave peace back to those she hurt the only way she could figure out how. I found that incredibly moving. Writing is a form of therapy to many writers: it's a way to talk about the things that linger on your mind without really talking about them exorcise demons, right wrongs and create a better world. This novel made me want to start writing again.This was a wonderful and rewarding read, a rich mix of Austen, Forster, Waugh and Woolf, and I loved every word of it so much more than I could have anticipated. I saw the movie, and while I often can't stand the sight of Keira Knightley, I do think that she was a perfect Cecilia, and that the movie was a flawless adaptation that perfectly captured the tone of McEwan's writing. 5 very bright stars and a spot of my \"favorites\" shelf.\n",

As if anyone would care about her graphomany. As if her magical thinking would have any other effect other than make her believe that she got her atonement by doing something that she believes useful. Good for her. Under all her everything she's still that brat who believes that the world's biggest problem is her play / her atonement / her fantasies / her and not the people whose lives she blew up. And everyone around her is not much brighter. Her so-called precociousness is basically too much free time on her hands. Maybe she should've been, I dunno, studying Math or Chinese to set off some of that fantasy keeping her up doing harm? Or washing dishes? Or helping whoever was cleaning their house? Betty? Or learning domestic economy or whatever it was that women were supposed to learn at that period? I'm totally sure that had her idle time been shortened by at least 50%, there wouldn't have been any grounds for the debacle. She would've been taught to distinguish between fantasy and actual stuff (don't tell me she was too young for it, kids as young as 3-4 can do that perfectly fine!) and that would've at least given her a chance to distinguish between her maniac perceptions and what she actually saw. As it was, she was half-mad with her fantastic thinking and was very far removed from real life. So, considering that I believe that the whole premise is ludicrous and the bunch of these MCs need a shrink and some sensible activities to do, I'm looking at the plot and thinking it's dreadful. I definitely dislike all the other reviewers' arguments about how she was a kid and didn't know what she was doing. Since, what does that really mean? What, every kid now has a free pass to go and destroy some lives? That's why kids don't vote, because they might not know what they are doing. And that's why they need upbringing and education and medical help (incl. psychiatric, if needed). The sex-rape-id-thing. What the hell was everyone thinking? A not-very-stable not-so-little girl accuses a boy of a rape and they just lap it up! How could she have seen his face in the dark?And what was her fragging deal? She was quite old to bother people into playing out her horrible plays? Isn't she then old enough to maybe think a bit in a straight way?! I think Robbie's just not very well-written. It's just as if the author wanted him to be a shade of some general partially randomized boy. You know, to give the general idea of all the wrongfully-accused young men who, well, got into mess not of their own making?Or is that the author just showing us that large chunks of the story are just Briony making all this stuff up as some sort of self-therapy? If so, how very nice for her. Basically, the only really fleshed out character is Briony. The rest read like ghosts: moth-like, we've got names, we've got them doing things but they are transparent. Likely that's the author letting us feel that we are seeing things second-hand with Briony's eyes.The atonement: None for anyone. We don't enter the same river twice: we may only dream about it.One can be sad with Briony not getting her chances but damn, the 1st part was such a stupid plot twist. On the chances:- she didn't get her memo for not making stuff up and subsequently, no chance for actual atonement for her / by her. Some things you can't take back so best to tread carefully all along.- quite a lot of characters didn't get the chance to live and love at all. Even the several years that were allotted to them before war: yes, to Robbie and Cecilia.B. basically robbed them of their whole lives: while war wasn't of her making, the aftermath of the rape debacle for the 2 of them was. And, as destiny would have it, that was all that there was to be. Until B's tender mercies.Briony being a l'enfant terrible:Q:She was one of those children possessed by a desire to have the world just so. Whereas her big sister’s room was a stew of unclosed books, unfolded clothes, unmade bed, unemptied ashtrays, Briony’s was a shrine to her controlling demon: (c) Dratt. This girl just has too much of free time on her hands. They should've just gotten her to do something useful with all that extra energy: study Chinese, go and train to become an Olympic-grade skater, study physics for science career... You know: useful stuff.Q:Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel’s skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know. (c) Briony's social skills are pretty much nonexistent. Kudos to McIan for getting how children can sometimes think but drat, that's horrible to follow. She actually tries to rope her cousins into a play rehearsals no more than 6 minutes after their arrival. She doesn't even have the slightest idea that maybe some people would hate the idea of participating in a play. Why did no one stop (even for a bit) to discuss with her how other people might feel? Kids can be especially dumb when it comes to other people. I'm pretty sure she had no idea that other people might have personal lives out of her censoring.And her interaction with Lola?Q:Briony struggled to grasp the difficult thought, wasn’t there manipulation here, wasn’t Lola using the twins to express something on her behalf, something hostile or destructive? Briony felt the disadvantage of being two years younger than the other girl, of having a full two years’ refinement weigh against her, and now her play seemed a miserable, embarrassing thing. …she proceeded to outline the plot, even as its stupidity began to overwhelm her. (c) Well, it was a miserable thing. Who are we kidding? Briony's very egoistic from the start and she seems to be very much in love with her older brother. What's it with McEwan and incest themes? Well, at least this time around the incest is more of a subconscious longing than action plan.Q:She was not playing Arabella because she wrote the play, she was taking the part because no other possibility had crossed her mind, because that was how Leon was to see her, because she was Arabella. (c) God, she was Arabella? She was supposed to demonstrate to her bro that he should marry a nice girl she approves of. And then what, because of her cousins' freckles, now she is Arabella? Melodramatic much?Q:As she saw the dress make its perfect, clinging fit around her cousin and witnessed her mother’s heartless smile, Briony knew her only reasonable choice then would be to run away, to live under hedges, eat berries and speak to no one, and be found by a bearded woodsman one winter’s dawn, curled up at the base of a giant oak, beautiful and dead, and barefoot, or perhaps wearing the ballet pumps with the pink ribbon straps… (c) Anyway, what's Briony's deal that even after all the time, plays seem to remain her only instrument of self-expression?Q:I was elated and urgently wanted to tell my closest friends.(c) That's Briony rejoicing on the vascular dementia news. Isn't she still a drama queen? Other fun ideas:Q:It was not generally realised that what children mostly wanted was to be left alone. (c)\n",

      "Sometimes when I write these reviews, especially when they're of novels with widespread popularity and critical acclaim, I start to feel like a real curmudgeon. Is there anything really wrong with Ian McEwan's “Atonement?” Is it not a compelling story well told? Is the writing not clear, succinct, and free of pretentiousness? Does McEwan not draw the reader into a well-imagined world and hold him there until the last page? The answer to all these questions is yes. Yet still, yet still...Maybe it's all the acclaim that “Atonement” received when first published and the literary prizes it either won or was shortlisted for, or maybe it's the comparison I'm drawing – unfairly, to be sure – with some of the classic novels I've been reading lately, but I just don't see why McEwan's book has been held up as one of the great works of literary fiction of recent years. (Or maybe everything else from the last several years is that much worse?) My chief problem with “Atonement” is it just never feels fully real, like great novels do. I could never picture Briony, Cecilia, Robbie and the book's other characters existing beyond their words and actions on the page. They never become something more than characters in a novel – never become real living, breathing people, as is the case with truly great works of literature. The whole book just feels far too mannered, too neatly composed, too written.Spoilers to follow here, so skip the next paragraph if you haven't yet read “Atonement” and plan to.Does this maybe speak, though, to McEwan's genius? After all, in his nod to the art of metafiction, McEwan makes the novel not really his novel at all, but rather one written by his character Briony Tallis, so that all but the last section of the book, which is told first-person by Briony, becomes a novel within the novel. A defender of the book who accepts everything I've said up until this point might rightfully argue that the novel-within-the-novel's weaknesses speak to the who the character of Briony actually is, and to her shortcomings as a novelist. If that were McEwan's intention, it's kind of a brilliant move: a good novelist purposely writing in an average way because the character actually telling the story is herself an average novelist. OK, but even if I accept this argument – and even though I made the argument myself, I'm not sure it holds water – I still don't want to read an entire novel that's simply average, even if it's intended to be.Spoilers over.Getting back to my original point, though, why do I feel the urge to demand that every piece of literature – even one well-loved, and with critical regard – need be as brilliant as one by, say, Nabokov? (Though, to be fair, McEwan is asking for this comparison, as Nabokov mastered the metafiction toyed with in “Atonement” back when McEwan was just a wee lad.) Can't some literary novels just be an enjoyable read without achieving a place in the pantheon of great literature? Isn't there, alongside Nabokov and Bellow, a place for writers such as John Irving and Ian McEwan? (And is that too insulting to McEwan? Too flattering to Irving?) And, finally, have I become, as a reader, too much a curmudgeon?\n",

Anyway, I quite liked the film, or at least it made an impression on me at the time. Although I've only seen it once, I can still see images: Cecilia's green dress and the beach at Dunkirk particularly come to mind. I also remembered the plot, and therefore its twist. So when I read the novel, there were no suprises. Knowing what was going to happen, I paid attention to see if I could pick up the clues and yes, they were there in the text. Not that I think a reader who didn't know the plot could work it all out just on the basis of the clues, but at least McEwan wasn't cheating. Anyway, while I don't think McEwan is ever going to be my favourite novelist. There's a brittleness to him (or something, I'm not quite sure what it is) that I find unappealing. However, in this novel he poses important questions about love, guilt, redemption, truth and the nature and purpose of fiction. McEwan writes excellent prose and he does the meta-fiction thing extremely well. I doubt I'll be reading this again, but I'm glad that I've read it once. Now I understand why my friend loved it so much. I just wish she was still here so we could talk about it.\n",

      "Atonement is a post-modernist interpretation of historical fiction. How historical fiction is a kind of double fiction, a fiction within a fiction. Not that McEwan’s intellectual mischief detracts from his gift for storytelling. For this is a compelling and moving story and it’s not until the end that we are called upon to question the roots of storytelling. How all the stories we tell require a measure of illusion to sustain them. And how narrative itself is a selective process – brilliantly exposed here when Robbie sends the wrong letter to Cecelia.  The atmospheric ideal drift of life on a country estate replete with overly familial class divisions quotes early/middle 20th century historical fiction themes with a slightly troubling fidelity to clichéd tropes. For a while it’s almost as if McEwan has gone soft in his old age. But it’s as if he is working his way through 20th century British literature in this novel whose subject, beneath the ostensible one of guilt and atonement, is essentially narrative itself. To the clichéd backdrop of the country estate he brings in Virginia Woolf’s floating impressionistic technique of creating biography, Lawrence’s use of the repressed sex instinct as plot crucible and catalyst and Forster’s showdown moment in the Maribor cave when deep seated submerged prejudice and crowd contagion convince everyone of guilt. It’s almost as if McEwan is playfully writing himself into British literary history. The second part is all gritty realism – a high definition account of the brutalities of war. One effect of war is to scramble formerly sustaining narratives. This is what happens to both Robbie and Briony. His experience of blame and hers of guilt change. War provides Briony with the possibility of atonement in the form of self-sacrifice and bullies Robbie into understanding that holding one individual to account for his wretched fate is absurd. Both begin to construct a new narrative, no more true perhaps than the former. Because this is a novel about the enormous power but, at bottom, creative inauthenticity of narrative. We believe in what it is necessary for us to believe. \n",

Ian McEwan is such a master of language and storycraft.I devoured this book in a day. Less than a day. Ignoring all other work to do so. And it was TOTALLY worth it. I can't think of what to praise first this point, so I'm going to go in random order. I'll start with the language. It's enthralling. It's that that draws you into the story. The story moves rather slowly, really. Half of the book takes place on a single day. But it is the language that makes you not care. The wordchoice is enchanting, just so. Gorgeous imagery interposed with just the right touch of magic to keep it beautifully fresh. He weaves his images throughout the text, having them pop up again and again, subtly. For instance, a pair of boy's pajamas becomes a symbol of war and horror as well as innocence ruined and then vague oppression and doubt renewed throughout the novel. A finger becomes a sense of self and changed identity at various points. It's just gorgeously done.The storycraft is so perfect too. I love how he chooses to do it, switching from perspective to perspective, but always with the center on this delusional little girl, and the echoes of her own storymaking. It is story that screws over them all in the end. But it is story that resurrects them too. I loved his inward musings on writing, and his critique of his own writing within the text. It's a bit of a breaking of the fourth wall that's done with a rather sad irony, but it still brought a smile to my face.I really enjoyed the themes that he explored too. Eventually I'll post some of my favorite quotes to give an idea of the beauty of the language and ideas that he explores as well, but in general... I think my favorite idea that he dealt with was the idea of order as a kind of childishness. As a kind of little, small denial of the world. The entire book shows the folly of order and what it does to our souls and minds. (quotes to come on this). I also loved his treatment of the all consuming nature of guilt. Atonement. Atonement indeed.Amazing. I cannot recommend this enough. \n",

      "There are so many angles and perceptions to consider in this book. Sometimes the end can make a book and that is certainly the case here where the story is left open for interpretation. This is a book that leaves you thinking and considering, making up your own conclusions--and strong enough characters to make you want to.The first few chapters I did find my mind wandering through lengthy descriptions (I'll call it beautiful, poetic scenery), and yet that scenery set a lackadaisical feel vital to the innocence and peace of that opening day. It's not just the easy-going feel of pre-war life McEwan was portraying. On a second read, I find a strain, a desire to understand every motive and action. And in those details I find sadness that life never moved on. It was played over and over again trying to find meaning and purpose to each detail. The slowness is painstaking analysis. There is a reason for the meticulous care with which each detail is described and the read well worth the persistence to the end.Even from the beginning I was intrigued with the story and found the characters compelling. I just loved Briony's capricious character, her innocent yet eloquently advanced mind. I could despise the nosy little sister and sympathize with the fearful inactive girl all in one breath. I could hate Paul's conceit and Lola's pleas for attention and understand the muteness all the same. But mostly I could sympathize and relate to Robbie and Cecilia as likable characters, wanting to add more time to their brief, interrupted interactions. I found myself ever-fearful for the end and therefore could not put the book down.Spoilers in my analysis to death.Despite Briony's foreshadowing (saying she would rewrite the fountain scene from all perspectives), I did not suspect the end. I expected the separation but not the invention of this whole story. Because of the story in a story format, you can interpret the few authentic scenes anyway you like and not take her word for any of it. That is what I love about the story, particularly on a second read, that I can question motives assigned to characters instead of take it for face value. At one point reading Robbie's thoughts I considered the layers: Ewan writing Briony writing Robbie and paused in awe at McEwan's talent. Because of the layers, McEwan has the unique opportunity to add insight and symbolism, even study questions as commentary. Take Briony's comment when relieved to see Robbie at Cecilia's that Robbie's death would have been \"outlandish, against all odds\" and would have made no sense. Or the letter from the editor telling her the story was incomplete: \"how might [her misunderstanding:] affect the lives of the two adults?\" And while vivid her descriptions of light and shade she should create \"light and shade within the narrative itself.\" To which you can't help but wonder about light and shade in the story and characters. In what other novel can the author analyze his own work and insert his own cues for study?I was confused at the drastic abbreviation of Robbie's war tour--though I enjoyed considering the shrapnel as a physical expression of his hidden wound. It was so obvious why the section quit there, but I couldn't believe it ended there; I had to hold out hope however thin the thread. I thought Briony's atonement would come as a nurse on duty, and I held my breath waiting for the improbable meeting. Her interaction with the dying French boy showed how much she wanted that redemption from Robbie by consoling and listening to what cannot be fixed. How she longed for closure with him. I doubt Robbie hated Briony. In her self-deprecation her interpretation is harsh. I think exasperation at a nosy child whom you adore but all of a sudden can't approach because her vivid imagination has turned to fear is sufficient emotion. I liked Robbie enough to think he could have forgiven her. If anything he was the one who was understanding and forgiving while Cecilia was ready to throw out her family to show her commitment to Robbie. I think Cecilia and Robbie were on the verge of forgiving Briony, but Briony could not allow herself to believe so without diminishing her guilt. She states \"neither Briony nor the war had destroyed\" their love. Even though she says so about her made-up gift of an ending, can't she see some redemptive power for herself, even in the \"bleakest realism\"? I was so confused at the unexpected way the reunion scene between Robbie and Celia. It was so implausible and awkward and I wondered how the story had gotten off course and how Robbie had gotten there from France. His reaction was not anything like I expected, that after everything he had been through, he could still hold that much hate for Briony. And yet that was its intention. On a second read, it's one of my favorite parts as she gives us a glimpse of the verbal rebut she so longed for and some of the best layered meanings. I love how her novel sprouted from a desire to amend, but offered as a response to Robbie's invented request: \"She knew what was required of her...a new draft, an atonement.\" While Briony should take culprit for the loss of several years, she can't for their entire lives, for the years fate and the war stole away. And she can't even take full credit for those years. It was not her \"crime\" but her interpretation of one that fueled the problem. She spent her life in remorse, letting her decision shape her life and self worth. I think she more than paid her debt for what was a misunderstanding, a mistake, not cruel revenge. She got caught up in her perception and forced facts to fit her assumptions--ones she full-heartedly believed. It is Lola unwilling to admit her part in the sexual encounter that should be atoning. Paul with his unrepentant spirit that should atone for another man paying for his crime. And even her mother making the improbable leap from inappropriate love letter to assault to break a servant's son connection with her daughter. Surely, she is just as guilty but seems unwillingly to accept her part in losing relationships with both her daughters. Briony is the only one in this story willing to atone for the tragedy. I didn't find her silence at the wedding cowardice: what good would it have served to ruin yet another couple's happiness? Her appearance was sufficient.I wish Cecilia were more vocal the night they waited for his return. Sure the social class and unacceptable library behavior restrained her, but I wanted passion as proof of her love. Her silence annoyed and confused me as much as Briony's self-righteous witness angered me. But despite her hesitation that night, considering Cecilia's drastic reaction to her family, I want to believe the relationship must have been long-term, more serious. I'd like to think as her atonement Briony was as hard on herself as possible. I want to think that instead of unrequited love there was secret love undiscovered away from home but unable to pass inquisitive eyes. It doesn't atone, but it makes it less severe. Briony's initial reaction to the fountain scene was that Robbie was proposing marriage. It could be accurate that Briony happened upon a lover's quarrel: Cecilia wanted to keep the relationship hushed from her parents and when Robbie was too personal in broad daylight she snapped. The letter could have been a joke from a guy asking for a moment alone with his girlfriend and in it his hesitance to jump from playful to committed. The story invented, while the most probable, was the most severe option she could conjure up and not the one I wanted to believe. I know I'm grasping at straws, but I want to believe Briony was wrong. The beauty of the story is I can.The fact that I cared enough about the characters to want that for them, to simmer over it after I closed the book, reluctant to have it end, testifies to the power of the story. Despite my longing, I wouldn't necessarily consider the story of Robbie and Cecilia a complete tragedy. If one had survived to grieve and hate then yes, but to have such intense love (to have \"a reason for life\" as Cecilia put it) and be reunited after a short time gives their lives meaning and purpose and only makes it tragic for Briony left to regret the consequences of her rash judgment without ever hope of reconciliation. There in lies the tragedy: in a girl's life altered, not in the love story.Some of my favorite quotes:It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter there different minds and show how they had a equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.(Robbie of meeting Cecilia) It would be worse, but he still wanted it. he had to have it. He wanted it to be worse. Every now and then quite unintentionally someone taught you something about yourself.(Robbie & Cecilia uttering each other's names) It sounded like a new word--the syllables remained the same, the meaning was different.(Briony on guilt) How quite refined the methods of self-torture, invading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.Memories--bleached colorless through overuse.With the clarity of passionA person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.She was the sort of girl who lived in her thoughts.It was common enough to see so much death and want a child, common therefore human, and he wanted it all the more. When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere, of an ordinary life, a family line, connection.Now was her chance to proclaim in public all the private anguish and purge herself of all that she had done wrong. Before the altar of this most rational of churches.To Briony it appeared her life was gong to be lived in one room without a door.What she felt was more like homesickness though there was no source for it, no home. \n",

That was until I read the last section. It was heartbreaking. Those few pages made me re-think about the 3 stars. They compelled me to reward this novel with 4 stars. It deserved it.All Briony Tallis wanted was for her elder brother Leon to enjoy the play she had written and was planning to enact it with her cousins, when he returned home after college. All her plans were ruined by her rude cousins who fought with her. Sad, she begins to wander around her house, with her thoughts. She spots her elder sister Cecilia and their cleaning lady's son Robbie in a situation she cant comprehend. Her vivid, wild imagination prompts her to immediately write a story. She thinks that Robbie has set his mind to do something evil and she needs to protect her sister.When a family tragedy occurs, Briony decides to take charge and accuse Robbie of a crime he has not committed. This turns the life of a lot of people upside down. As Briony grows up, she realises that she has made a mistake. The rest of the novel is about how she tries to atone her mistake and whether she succeeds or not.What I loved about this book:Character development: Even though the initial chapters were boring, McEwan has done a great job in writing the thoughts and perspectives of each character. The thoughts of Briony who wants to be a writer, the anguish of an ill mother when she thinks about her daughters, the thoughts and actions of Robbie and Cecilia.. All these were written with perfection.Conclusion: As heartbreaking as it was, this is the point in which the novel turned from an average book to a spectacular one.Originality of Plot: The story idea was original and realistic.Things that disappointed me:Beginning: It was dragging. I guess it needs editing. Those initial chapters were required to build the story, but they needn't be so lengthy.Part 2: After the story started moving, the book was really interesting. But when I reached part 2, I just didnt understand why it needed to be so long and it felt so disconnected from part 1.Portrayal of Briony: I believe that Briony was almost innocent, considering her age and what she witnessed. But all through the book, I felt McEwan was trying to portray her as someone evil and mischievous. The young villain of the story. But her motives were honest and just. I dont know why the police and investigators didnt do a good job. They could have asked where each of the characters where during the search. *Spoiler Alert*( An afterthought on this point. Maybe Briony was portrayed as a lying, unreliable witness and a cruel girl by the author because she is the writer of the story and it's all that she can do under the given circumstances: make herself look like the bad guy, as a small penance for ruining the lives of her sister and Robbie.)Missing pieces: I wish McEwan had written a bit more about the interrogation and what was going through the minds of each of the family members after the \"tragedy\". Also how Cecilia acted after the arrest of Robbie. That's all I can think about now! I'm eager to hear the thoughts and opinions of other readers about this book😊!!Watched the movie and loved it. This is one of the few books in which I found the movie adaptation more interesting than the book.\n",

Maybe it's because I've watched the movie (which seems to follow only the first part of this novel). Things wrap up beautifully and leaves you with a feeling of being cheated of the truth. I liked it a lot and found Ian McEwan's story-telling compelling and highly interesting. \n",
