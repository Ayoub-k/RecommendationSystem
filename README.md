# Recommendation System

## Description
- Our recommendation system is based on a hybrid approach that will combine several prediction methods: we use collaborative filtering (k-NN and factorization matrix) and content-based recommendation (statistical techniques and TF-IDF method). In the collaborative filtering part we use other techniques to compute the similarity between users or between articles such as (Pearson coefficient, Euclidean distance, cosine similarity). We do the scrapping in the Good reads site to collect data and remedy the cold start problem.
